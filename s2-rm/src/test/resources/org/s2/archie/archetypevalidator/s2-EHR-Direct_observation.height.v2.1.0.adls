			purpose = <"To record the length of the body from crown of head to sole of foot of an individual - either measured or approximated, and either in a standing or recumbent position.">
			use = <"To be used for recording the measured height or body length of an individual at any point in time.  A statement identifying the physical incompleteness of the body can be recorded in the 'Confounding factors' protocol Node, if required.  This is the usual archetype to be used for a typical measurement of height or body length, independent of the clinical setting.
            
            Can also be used for recording an approximation of height or body length measurement in a clinical scenario where it is not possible to measure an accurate height or length - for example, measuring an uncooperative child.  This is not modelled explicitly in the archetype as the openEHR Reference model allows approximations  for any Quantity data type by setting the attribute Magnitude_status to the value '~'.  At implementation, for example, an application user interface could allow clinicians to select an appropriately labelled check box adjacent to the Height data field to indicate that the recorded height is an approximation, rather than actual.
            
            In general, length measurements are recommended for children under 2 years of age and individuals who cannot stand; height measurements for all others.
            
            When recording the first length of an infant shortly after birth, \\\"birth length\\\", use the event \\\"Birth\\\".
            
            Use to record growth or loss of height.  This can currently be modelled by constraining the 'any event' to an interval event within a template, with the associated mathematical function of increase or decrease, as appropriate.">
