            - to record a patient's primary or preferred language, use this archetype within the context of Node.communication;
            - to record the preferred or required language as part of a request for an interpreter, use Node.interpreter_requirements;
            - to record the language used by an interpreter within the context of a clinical consultation, use this archetype within ACTION.interpretation.
            
            Use a separate instance of this archetype to record each language in the situation where multiple languages need to be recorded, for example Norwegian and Swahili.">

            Not to be used to record details about a request for interpreter services - use Node.Interpreter_requirements with a suitable INSTRUCTION archetype, for example INSTRUCTION.service_request.
            
            Not to be used to record details about an interpretation that was performed - use the proposed ACTION.interpretation.">
