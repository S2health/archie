			use = <"Use to record structured details about a physical site on or within the human body that is described in terms of the direction, and optionally the distance, of the site from a central landmark. The direction will be relative to the identified reference direction which may be implied in some examinations - for example, the 12 o'clock in examination of the breast or anus.
            
            This archetype is specifically designed to be used within the context of any appropriate ENTRY or Node archetypes which supply the context of the identified body site, or nesting in the 'Alternative Structure' SLOT within the Node.anatomical_location.
            
            In the situation where the Node.anatomical_location can only be used to name a large and/or non-specific body part, the use of this archetype within the 'Alternative Structure' SLOT will support recording of a more precise location - for example, a haemorrhoid located at 7 o'clock, where the 12 o'clock reference point is the perineum, or anterior surface of the body, with the patient in the lithotomy position.">
