			purpose = <"To record a clinical context-specific or time-specific qualifier for a specified problem or diagnosis.">
			use = <"Use to record a relevant context-specific or time-specific qualifier that provides additional detail which is relevant at the time of recording or within the clinical context where a problem or diagnosis is recorded. The qualifier may not be appropriate at another time or in another clinical context. 
            
            This archetype is designed to be included in Status SLOT in the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype. The intent is for the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype to hold all of the information that applies in all contexts, in contrast to this archetype describing only information that depends on the context of use.
            
            IMPORTANT NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION: 
            - It is not intended or implied that any or all of these qualifiers should be used within the same context or period of time. In contrast to the usual design of archetypes, this archetype has been deliberately designed to collect a number of common qualifiers into one place in an effort to attempt some simple standardisation within a very messy area of clinical practice. It is acknowledged that the data Nodes contained in this archetype embrace many different, and sometimes even competing, concepts. This has been done mainly to prevent the need for multiple qualifier archetypes, each containing only one or two data Nodes. 
            - Some of these data Nodes are potentially directly conflicting if used simultaneously within the same context, for example it would not make sense to have an 'inactive' problem together with an Episode that is 'ongoing'. As such, these status qualifiers should be used with extreme care as they are variably applied in practice and interoperability cannot be assured unless usage guidelines are clearly defined within the clinical community in which the 'Problem/Diagnosis' and 'Problem/Diagnosis qualifier' archetype pair may be shared. 
            
            Full DRG coding will require the DRG-related data Nodes from this archetype in combination with data Nodes from other archetypes.">
