			purpose = <"To record the amount of oxygen available in the air the subject inspires at the time of observation, or the amount of oxygen that is to be delivered, if part of an order.">
			use = <"Use within an INSTRUCTION archetype to specify an order of oxygen, in an ACTION archetype to record performed oxygen therapy, or within OBSERVATION archetypes such as Blood gases or Respirations, as part of patient state, where knowledge of ambient oxygen status is critical to interpretation of the observation.
            
            The SLOT 'Oxygen delivery detail' can be used to specify additional structured information on the oxygen delivery, for example humidification or assisted ventilation. This will be relevant when there is an OBSERVATION archetype at top level, where this archetype is nested, for example OBSERVATION.pulse_oximetry. In other use cases, where the oxygen delivery itself is the concept, for example an archetype about mechanical ventilation, this archetype will be useful to record the amount of oxygen the individual is receiving.
            
            Also use in calculation of FiO₂/PaO₂ ratio, in addition to other algorithms in intensive care medicine, for example oxygen extraction ratio, etc.
            
            Atmospheric pressure is assumed to equivalent to sea-level pressure, unless otherwise specified.
            
            Where not specifically recorded values of 21% O₂, FiO₂ of 0.21 and oxygen flow rate of zero may be assumed.
            
            'Inspired oxygen' implies the amount of oxygen that was ordered or actioned, and normally reported in clinical records e.g.' the patient is on 30% Oxygen' and is not intended to capture the actual 'physiological' amount of oxygen that the patient receives, which will vary depending on the delivery method and other external conditions, such as whether the individual is breathing shallowly or is frequently removing the nasal prongs.">
