            This archetype has been designed for broad reuse within other archetypes that need to identify the use of a specific bioreagent. For example, to nest within the 'Procedure detail' SLOT in the ACTION.procedure archetype in assisted reproduction treatment procedures such as: 
            - oocyte denudation; 
            - assisted oocyte activation; 
            - cryopreservation and thawing of cells or embryos; and
            - fertilisation by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record data about medicinal products that exert a direct pharmacological, metabolic or immunologic effect. For example: a medicine that requires a prescription should be recorded using the  INSTRUCTION.medication_order archetype, focused on the active ingredients, dosage etc.
            
            Not to be used to record data about medical devices, instruments or equipment used during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures - use the appropriate archetype for this purpose.">
