            This archetype is intended to be used to record details of a medication or component of a medication where the form and detailed ingredients of the medication need to be specified in more detail, for example, infusions and ad hoc mixtures, or where there is no medication terminology available. In the context of an order for administration or dispensing of a medication, nest this archetype within the 'Medication details' SLOT within the Order.medication_order archetype. In the context of recording the actual administration or dispensing or a medication, nest this archetype within the 'Medication details' SLOT within the Action.medication archetype.
            
            This archetype may be redundant in situations where ordering a medication via prescription uses a terminology to identify the medication item. In that case the brand or product name may identify the form and strength of the substance.">
