			use = <"Use for recording findings observed during the physical examination of an identified macroscopic localised structural change or damage to normal tissue. This archetype is intended to be used to describe both benign and malignant lesions.
            
            This archetype is intended to be used to describe single localised lesions. To describe localised Nodes of lesions such as a Node of moles, use an appropriate Node archetype. This archetype may be nested inside such an archetype to describe single lesions which are part of the Node.
            
            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination findings' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam, Node.exam-skin or other Node.exam-archetypes, but can also be used within any other OBSERVATION, ACTION or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate - for example, Node.exam-breast or Node.exam-penis.
            
            This archetype may be specialised to enable recording details only relevant to a subset of lesions. An example of this can be specialising the archetype for wounds/ulcers, to allow recording information about wound edges, wound bed, undermining, or exudate.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data Node.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record findings about an imaging lesion. Use the Node.imaging_exam-abnormality archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record findings about non-localised or whole-organ eruptions such as a chickenpox rash covering the entire skin surface. Use the Node.symptom_sign archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record a macroscopic pathology examination of a specimen from a lesion. Use an appropriate Node archetype within the OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result archetype.
            
            Not to be used for recording the clinical history of a lesion - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes, for example OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom_sign.">
