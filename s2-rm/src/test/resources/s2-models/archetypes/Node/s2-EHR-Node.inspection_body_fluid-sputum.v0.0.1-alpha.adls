            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used as the framework for recording details about examination of sputum. It may be used:
            - in the 'Examination findings' SLOT within many of the Node.exam family of archetypes and related inspection archetypes;
            - in the 'Physical properties' SLOT within the Node.specimen archetype; and
            - within other OBSERVATION or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
            
            While this archetype will most likely be used in the context of a living subject, it is also appropriate to use in recording autopsy findings.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical description' data Node.">

            Not to be used to record the inspection of blood or blood clots, but only to record the presence of blood or blood clots within sputum.
            
            Not to be used for recording measurements of sputum volume - use OBSERVATION archetypes for this purpose. For example: OBSERVATION.fluid_output.
            
            Not to be used to record details about a non-physiological fluid.
            
            Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes. For example: OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom_sign.">
