            The intended scope for this archetype is to eventually record all detailed findings on radiological examination of the hip joint using any modality. It is anticipated that further data Nodes may be added as requirements are identified and confirmed.
            
            This archetype is designed to be nested within the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result or within other relevant Node.imaging_exam archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate. If this archetype needs to be extended with further levels of structured findings, additional instances of the Node.imaging_exam or its specialisations can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record findings observed outside the identified body structure or region. Use a separate instance of one or more archetypes from the Node.imaging_exam family for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record details related to the overall findings, context or technical details related to a complete imaging examination test result. Use the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result for this purpose. For example, comments on the study quality, differential diagnoses, and overall impression.">
