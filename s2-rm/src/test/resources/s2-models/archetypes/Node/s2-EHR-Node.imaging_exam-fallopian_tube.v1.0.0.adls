            The intended scope for this archetype is to eventually record all detailed findings on radiological examination about the fallopian tube using any modality, including examinations using contrast, such as Hysterosalpingography (HSG) or Hysterosalpingo-Contrast Sonography (HyCoSy). It is anticipated that further data Nodes may be added as requirements are identified and confirmed. 
            
            This archetype is designed to be nested within the 'Additional details' SLOT in the Node.imaging_exam-uterine_body, the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result or within other relevant Node.imaging_exam archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate. If this archetype needs to be extended with further levels of structured findings, additional instances of the Node.imaging_exam or its specialisations can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT.
            
            Details about medication or contrast medium administered as part of an imaging examination will be recorded using the ACTION.medication archetype, usually linked from the 'Procedure' data Node within the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result archetype. 
            
            A summary of any issues arising during the procedure, such as an increased resistance observed while flushing with contrast, should be recorded in the 'Comment' data Node within this archetype or the 'Procedure summary' data Node within the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result. Details related to the procedure can be recorded in a separate Procedure report using the ACTION.procedure archetype.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record imaging examination findings for any body structure or region other than a single fallopian tube. Use other archetypes from the Node.imaging_exam family for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record details related to the overall findings, context or technical details related to a complete imaging examination test result. Use the OBERSERVATION.imaging_exam_result for this purpose. For example, comments on the study quality, differential diagnoses, and overall impression.">
