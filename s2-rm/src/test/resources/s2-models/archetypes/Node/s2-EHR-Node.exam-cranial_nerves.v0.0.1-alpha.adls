            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam or Node.exam-nervous_system archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            Use to provide a framework in which Node archetypes for each cranial nerve can be nested in the appropriate SLOTs and other Node archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
