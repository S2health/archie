            The intended scope for the Node.imaging_exam family of archetypes to be used to record all detailed findings on radiological examination. The family of specialised archetypes are derived from this generic parent archetype, Node.imaging_exam, designed as a universal pattern for recording any findings in any specified body structure or region and using any modality.
            
            This archetype and its related family of specialisations are designed to be nested within the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result or within the 'Additional details' SLOT in other relevant Node.imaging_exam archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate. If this archetype or its specialisations need to be extended with further levels of detailed findings, additional instances of the Node.imaging_exam or its specialisations can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT.
            
            Each structure- or region-specific specialisation of this parent archetype is intended to be inclusive of all reasonably anticipated and relevant findings. For example, the Node.imaging_exam-ovary will support recording of all findings that would be expected in reporting on imaging of the ovary using any radiological modality, including the size of the ovary, largest follicle size and the diameter and description of specific follicles. Similarly, Node.imaging_exam-lymph_node_group will contain data Nodes required to record specific findings of a lymph node group, including its precise or relative location in the body and the number of lymph nodes in the group. 
            
            If an appropriate specialisation is not available for a body structure or region, this generic archetype can be used to record all relevant findings, including identification of the structure or region.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record findings observed outside the identified body structure or region. Use a separate instance of one or more archetypes from the Node.imaging_exam family for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record details related to the overall findings, context or technical details related to a complete imaging examination test result. Use the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result for this purpose. For example, comments on the study quality, differential diagnoses, and overall impression.">
