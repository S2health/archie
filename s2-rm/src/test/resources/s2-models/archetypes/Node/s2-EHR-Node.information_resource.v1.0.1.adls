            Examples include but are not limited to:
            - A book; 
            - A patient-education leaflet;
            - A mobile application;
            - A website, web portal or web-based platform; 
            - A podcast; or
            - An instructional video.
            
            The 'Content' data Node allows for the media content to be captured and stored using the Multimedia data type, or to be referenced elsewhere using the URI data type.
            
            If more than one resource is supplied as part of a single activity, use one instance of this archetype to represent each resource.
            
            The context of each resource should be contained within the parent archetype. For example: details about healthcare education material provided as part of a course will be captured within the ACTION.health_education archetype.">
