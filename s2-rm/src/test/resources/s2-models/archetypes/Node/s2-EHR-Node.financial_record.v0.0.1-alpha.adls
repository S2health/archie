            An individual may require more than one active financial record at a time, recorded in a separate instance of this archetype.
            
            Multiple instances of this archetype captured over time will result in the aggregation of a history of past and present financial situations.
            
            An active, or current financial situation may be implied from a 'Date commenced' but no 'Date ceased'. 
            
            If the financial situation changes significantly, then this should be recorded in a new instance of this archetype.
            
            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Financial record' SLOT within the EVALUATION.financial_summary archetype, but can also be used within any other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            These data Nodes are not intended to form a true and complete financial record, but have been designed only to support clinical and social care purposes.">
