            Use a separate instance of this archetype for each foetus or embryo.
            
            The intended scope for this Node.imaging_exam archetype is to eventually record all detailed findings on radiological examination of the foetus or embryo using any modality. It is anticipated that further data Nodes may be added as requirements are identified and confirmed. 
            
            This archetype is designed to be nested within the 'Additional details' SLOT in the Node.imaging_exam-uterine_body, the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result or within other relevant Node.imaging_exam archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate. If this archetype needs to be extended with further levels of structured findings, additional instances of the Node.imaging_exam or its specialisations can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT.">
