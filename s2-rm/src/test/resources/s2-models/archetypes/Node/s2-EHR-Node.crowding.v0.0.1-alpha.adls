            The identification of crowding, or overcrowding, is complex and varies between jurisdictions. It is usually assessed based on the number of people sharing the dwelling, their ages, their relationship and their gender. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535289/table/ch3.tab2/ for a range of examples.
