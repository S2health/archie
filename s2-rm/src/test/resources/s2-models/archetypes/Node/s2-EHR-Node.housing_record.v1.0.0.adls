            The scope of this archetype is inclusive of all residential settings occupied by an individual. For example: all rented homes over time; alternating between two homes during a specified period of time; transience, such as nomadic herders moving between seasonal pastures; itinerant travellers; or homeless.
            
            An individual may require more than one active housing record at a time. Each new residential setting or address should be recorded in a separate instance of this archetype. For example if an individual is moving from a house to another house or apartment, or moving the same mobile home from one address to another.
            
            Multiple instances of this archetype captured over time will result in the aggregation of a history of past and present housing situations.
            
            An active, or current housing situation may be implied from a 'Date commenced' but no 'Date ceased'. 
            
            If the housing situation changes significantly, such as a change of address or type of tenure, then this should also be recorded as a separate instance of this archetype.
            
            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Housing record' SLOT within the EVALUATION.housing_summary archetype, but can also be used within any other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            There may be some apparent or real overlap between the data Nodes in this archetype and housing/address details that may be stored as demographic details in clinical or administrative systems. These data Nodes have been designed specifically to support clinical purposes.">
