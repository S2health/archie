			purpose = <"To record details about a single episode of a reported symptom or sign including context, but not details, of previous episodes if appropriate.">
			use = <"Use to record details about a single episode of a symptom or reported sign in an individual, as reported by the individual, parent, care-giver or other party. It may be recorded by a clinician as part of a clinical history record as reported to them, observed by the clinician or self-recorded as part of a clinical questionnaire or personal health record. A complete clinical history or patient story may include varying level of details about multiple episodes of an identified symptom or reported sign, as well as multiple symptoms/signs.
            
            This archetype has been designed to record the positive presence of the symptom or sign as part of history taking using OBSERVATION.story, or in conjunction with a positive response to OBSERVATION.symptom_sign_screening.
            
            In the purest sense, symptoms are subjective observations of a physical or mental disturbance and signs are objective observations of the same, as experienced by an individual and reported to the history taker by the same individual or another party. From this logic it follows that we will need two archetypes to record clinical history - one for reported symptoms and another for reported signs. In reality this is impractical as it will require clinical data entry into either one of these models which adds signficant overheads to modellers and those entering data. In addition, there is often overlap in clinical concepts - for example, is previous vomiting or bleeding to be categorised as a symptom or reported sign? In response, this archetype has been specifically designed to provide a single information model that allows for recording of the entire continuum between clearly identifiable symptoms and reported signs.
            
            This archetype has been intended to be used as a generic pattern for all symptoms and reported signs. The 'Specific details' SLOT can be used to extend the archetype to include additional, specific data Nodes for more complex symptoms or signs. 
            
            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Structured detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.story archetype, but can also be used within other OBSERVATION or Node archetypes and in the 'Associated symptom/sign' or 'Previous episode' SLOT within other instances of this Node.symptom_sign archetype.">
			keywords = <"complaint", "symptom", "disturbance", "problem", "discomfort", "presenting complaint", "presenting symptom", "sign">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record screening questionnaire responses about the presence or absence of specific symptoms - use the OBSERVATION.symptom_sign_screening archetype for this purpose. However, this Node.symptom_sign archetype may be nested within the 'Screening details' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.symptom_sign_screening archetype if it is necessary to extend the questionnaire by recording details about symptom or sign.
            
            Not to be used to record that a symptom or sign was explicitly reported as not present - use Node.exclusion_symptom_sign carefully for specific purposes where the overheads of recording in this way warrant the additional complexity.
            
            Not to be used for recording objective findings as part of a physical examination - use OBSERVATION.exam and related examination Node archetypes for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used for diagnoses and problems that form part of a persisting Problem List - use EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis.
            
            Not to be used to record a formal and repeatable severity scale such as VAS or NRS. Use appropriate OBSERVATION archetypes for this purpose.">
