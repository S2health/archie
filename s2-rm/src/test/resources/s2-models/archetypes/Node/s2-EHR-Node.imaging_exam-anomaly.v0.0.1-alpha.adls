            If more than one anomaly has been identified within the context of the same body structure or region, use a separate instance of this archetype to describe each anomaly.
            
            The intended scope for this archetype is to eventually record all detailed findings on radiological examination of a anomaly using any modality. It is anticipated that further data Nodes may be added as requirements are identified and confirmed. Use cases include, but are not limited to:
            - a large, mixed solid/cystic anomaly containing teeth and hair, identified within the ovary - for example, a dermoid cyst;
            - a solid mass identified within the right upper lobe of the lung - for example, a past infection scar or a tumour;
            - a calcified anomaly identified within the left kidney - for example, a kidney calculus; or 
            - a soft tissue mass identified within the heart - for example, a thrombosis.
            
            This archetype is designed to be nested within the 'Additional details' SLOT in any of the Node.imaging_exam family of archetypes which will provide the context for the anomaly, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate. If this archetype needs to be extended with further levels of structured findings, additional instances of the Node.imaging_exam or its specialisations can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record findings that are reasonably anticipated for a specified body structure or region. Use specialised archetypes from the Node.imaging_exam family or the generic Node.imaging_exam archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record details related to the overall findings, context or technical details related to a complete imaging examination test result. Use the OBERSERVATION.imaging_exam_result for this purpose. For example, comments on the study quality, differential diagnoses, and overall impression.">
