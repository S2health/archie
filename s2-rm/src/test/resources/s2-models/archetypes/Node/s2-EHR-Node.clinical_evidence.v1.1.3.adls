            This archetype is designed to be nested within a SLOT in the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis, EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk, EVALUATION.health_risk, EVALUATION.contraindication, or similar summary archetypes, where the name of the assertion has already been specified in the EVALUATION, in order to extend its content with this additional and optional dataset. While LINKs within the openEHR Reference Model allow for linkage to data held elsewhere within the health record, this archetype has been developed to make this functionality explicit, and to enable clinical visibility and review of this data, where it may be relevant in a template or specification.
            
            The clinical evidence can be entered directly into this archetype as a 'Finding', or a citation can be used to explicitly point to data within the health record.">
