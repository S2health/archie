			purpose = <"To record details about the location of a person, physical building or landmark as they are known or understood in the course of clinical documentation.">
			use = <"Use to record details about the location of a person, physical building or landmark as they are known or understood in the course of clinical documentation, often ad hoc or when it is not appropriate or possible to use an address lookup service. Examples include:
            - the business address of an organization providing home care to an individual; or
            - the postal address of the copyholder of an advanced care record, within the EVALUATION.advance_care_directive archetype; or
            - the physical location of a fall or accident.
            
            The scope of this archetype has been constrained to carry the commonest structured components for identifying a specific physical building or landmark. In this context, a complete address may be described using:
            - One or more free text 'Address line' data Nodes to represent the huge variety of ways that ‘street-level' details may need to be recorded; and
            - 'Town' to represent a suburb, town, city, village, or community;
            - 'District/County' to represent a local government district;
            - 'State/Territory/Province’ to represent a major government district;
            - ‘Postcode’, and 
            - ‘Country'.
            However, this archetype can be extended to include additional fine-grained details about the address by nesting the Node.structured_address within the 'Structured address' SLOT.
            
            This Node.address archetype can also be used as a proxy for an address in formal demographic address data when reviewing a template with domain experts - for example, an assessment where reviewers would expect to see the individual's full contact details at the top of the assessment form.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record a fully structured address, such as described in ISO standards or as part of maintaining an official demographic register or index. Use an address lookup service, a formal Master Patient Index or a Health Provider Index for this purpose, or archetypes based on the openEHR Demographic Information Model.
            
            Not to be used to represent digital addresses for use in electronic communication. Use Node.electronic_communication for this purpose.
