            This archetype has been designed to be nested inside an ENTRY or appropriate Node archetype which will provide a clinical or pathological context and the tumour type for the TNM record - for example: the 'Specific details' SLOT within the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype; or nested in an appropriate histopathology-related Node archetype within the OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result context.
            
            Each cancer has a set of unique pTNM classification values. It is expected that this archetype will be further constrained to reflect the unique requirements for each tumour and edition of the TNM classification, using either an archetype specialisation or a template.
            
            With certain types of tumours, such as Hodgkin and other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, a different system for designating the extent of disease and prognosis is used. In these circumstances only the stage group is defined.">
