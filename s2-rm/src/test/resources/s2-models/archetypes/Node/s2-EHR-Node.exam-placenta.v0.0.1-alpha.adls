            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam, the 'Procedure detail' SLOT within the ACTION.procedure archetype, or the 'Additional details' SLOT within the EVALUATION.pregnancy_summary, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate. 
            
            Interpretation of the findings, for example 'No abnormality detected' or 'Moderate inflammation present', can be recorded using the 'Clinical interpretation' data Node.
            
            Use to provide a framework in which Node archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data Node.">
