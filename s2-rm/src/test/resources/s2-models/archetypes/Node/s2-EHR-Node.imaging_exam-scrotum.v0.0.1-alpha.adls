            Use to provide a framework in which Node archetypes can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT within this archetype to record additional nested levels of structured imaging findings for related body substructures or site-specific findings.">

Use the OBERSERVATION.imaging_exam_result for this purpose. For example, comments on the study quality, differential diagnoses, and overall impression.">
