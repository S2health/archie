            An individual may undertake multiple training courses simultaniously, or overlapping. Each education or training should be recorded in a separate instance of this archetype. Multiple instances of this archetype captured over time will build a cumulative history of past and present education and training.
            
            Current education or training may be implied from a 'Date commenced' but no 'Milestone achieved'.
            
            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Education record' SLOT within the EVALUATION.education_summary archetype, but can also be used within any other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.">
