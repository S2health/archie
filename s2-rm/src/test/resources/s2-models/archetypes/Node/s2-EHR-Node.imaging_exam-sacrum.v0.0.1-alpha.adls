            The intended scope for this archetype is to eventually record all detailed findings on radiological examination of the pelvis using any modality. It is anticipated that further data Nodes may be added as requirements are identified and confirmed.
            
            This archetype and its related family of specialisations are designed to be nested within the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result or within the 'Additional details' SLOT in other relevant Node.imaging_exam archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate. If this archetype or its specialisations need to be extended with further levels of detailed findings, additional instances of the Node.imaging_exam or its specialisations can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record imaging examination findings for any body structure or region other than the sacrum. Use other archetypes from the Node.imaging_exam family for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record details related to the overall findings, context or technical details related to a complete imaging examination test result. Use the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result for this purpose. For example, comments on the study quality, differential diagnoses, and overall impression.">
