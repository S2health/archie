			use = <"Use to record details of a person as they are known or understood in the course of clinical documentation, often ad hoc or when it is not appropriate or possible to use a formal demographic register or index. Examples include:
            - the copyholder of an advanced care record, using the 'Copyholder' SLOT within the EVALUATION.advance_care_directive archetype;
            - the role and contact details of a named contact person within an organization, using the 'Contact person' SLOT within the Node.organization archetype;
            - details about a relative in a family history record, using the 'Family member details' SLOT within the openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.family_history archetype; 
            - the name of the person who collected a laboratory specimen from a patient, using the 'Specimen collector details' within the Node.specimen archetype; or
            - a witness to a fall or accident, using the 'Witness' SLOT within the Node.health_event archetype.
            
            In most simple clinical recording use cases, the unstructured 'Name' Node within the Node.person archetype will be sufficient to record the name of a person as part of a health record. However, in circumstances where a structured name is necessary or desirable for clinical recording purposes, nest this archetype within the 'Structured name' SLOT in Node.person archetype. If the Node.structured_name archetype is nested within the 'Structured name' SLOT, any or all of the data Nodes can be combined together as a text string and represented in the 'Name' Node, as long as they are consistent.
            
            This archetype could also be used as a proxy for formal demographic data when reviewing a template with domain experts - for example, an assessment where reviewers would expect to see a person's details at the top of the assessment form.">
