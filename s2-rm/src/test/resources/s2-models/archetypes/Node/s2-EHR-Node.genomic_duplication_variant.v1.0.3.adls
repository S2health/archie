            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Structured variant' SLOT within the Node.genomic_variant_result archetype, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            In the examples in this archetype, lower case nucleotides are only intended to highlight the changed positions of the DNA sequence.
            All definitions and examples in this archetype follow the HGVS nomenclature.">

            Not to be used to record a change when there is no evidence that the extra copy of a sequence detected is in tandem (directly 3’-flanking the original copy). Use the Node.genomic_insertion_variant archetype for this purpose.">
