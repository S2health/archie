            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used as the framework for recording details about examination of any body fluid and the context of the anatomical site or source of the body fluid will be carried in the archetypes in which it is nested, including but not limited to:
            - in the 'Examination findings' SLOT within many of the Node.exam family of archetypes and related inspection archetypes;
            - in the 'Physical properties' SLOT within the Node.specimen archetype; and
            - within other OBSERVATION or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            In order to record examination findings for:
            - specific types of fluids with unique attributes that need to be recorded, it is intended that a specific Node archetype for this purpose be nested within the 'Specific findings' SLOT. For example additional details only relevant to clear fluids will be recorded within a specific archetype for this purpose that will effectively extend this generic body fluid archetype; and 
            - multicomponent body fluids such as amniotic fluid that may also contain obvious blood, meconium or pus, it is intended that one instance of this archetype be used to describe the amniotic fluid overall and additional instances of this same archetype will be nested with the 'Specific findings' SLOT to represent each of blood, meconium and pus.
            
            Body fluid is a liquid that originates from the human body, and this archetype is intended to support detailed description of:
            - normal physiological fluids; 
            - physiological fluids that may be altered due to a pathological process; and
            - fluids generated as part of a pathological process within the body.
            
            Extracellular body fluid examples include, but are not limited to:
            - Amniotic fluid;
            - Blood and plasma;
            - Cerebrospinal fluid;
            - Discharge;
            - Urine;
            - Pus;
            - Saliva;
            - Sputum;
            - Synovial fluid;
            - Sweat; and
            - Vomitus.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
            
            While this archetype will most likely be used in the context of a living subject, it is also appropriate to use in recording autopsy findings.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical description' data Node.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the inspection of urine - use the specialisation Node.inspection_body_fluid-urine for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the inspection of sputum - use the specialisation Node.inspection_body_fluid-sputum for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the inspection of blood or blood clots, but only to record the presence of blood or blood clots within other fluids.
            
            Not to be used for recording measurements of fluid volume - use OBSERVATION archetypes for this purpose. For example: OBSERVATION.fluid_output.
            
            Not to be used to record details about a non-physiological fluid.
            
            Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes. For example: OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom_sign.
            
            Not to be used to record the results of a urinalysis test - use OBSERVATION.urinalysis for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the other details about a specimen for use in laboratory testing - use Node.specimen. Note: despite this exclusion, it is reasonable to use this archetype within the Node.specimen to describe physical properties about a body fluid as noted above.
            
            Not to be used to record the details about examination of faeces - use the Node.examination_faeces.">
