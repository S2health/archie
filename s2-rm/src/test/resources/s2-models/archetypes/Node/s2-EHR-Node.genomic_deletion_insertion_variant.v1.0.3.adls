            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Structured variant' SLOT within the Node.genomic_variant_result archetype, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            In the examples in this archetype, lower case nucleotides are only intended to highlight the changed positions of the DNA sequence.
            All definitions and examples in this archetype follow the HGVS nomenclature.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record information about variants of non-human DNA, or any kind of RNA or protein.
            
            Not to be used for recording information about a variant where one nucleotide is replaced by one other nucleotide. This is a substitution, and the archetype Node.genomic_substitution_variant should be used for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used for recording information about two variants separated by one or more nucleotides, except when the two variants are separated by one nucleotide and they affect only one amino acid.">
