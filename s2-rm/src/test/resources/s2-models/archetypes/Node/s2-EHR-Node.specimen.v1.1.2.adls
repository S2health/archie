            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the following use cases:
            - within INSTRUCTION.service_request or another laboratory-related INSTRUCTION archetype to describe a specimen that is to be collected, or to describe a specimen that accompanies a laboratory service request; 
            - within a laboratory-related ACTION archetype to describe specimen collection or a specimen that has been collected; or
            - within OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result or other laboratory reporting OBSERVATION archetypes to describe the specimen being reported.
            In addition this archetype can also be nested within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            The level of detail in this archetype is likely to exceed that currently collected in most laboratories. It has deliberately been designed to cater for a simple, single specimen collection; simultaneous collection of multiple specimens with a single request; and complex situations where it is required to record minute detail about the preparation and subdivision of a single specimen.
            
            The exact semantics of several Nodes of this archetype may change based on the context provided by the parent archetype in which it is nested. For example, the 'Collection method' Node in the context of an INSTRUCTION archetype is the requested collection method, while the same Node in the context of an ACTION archetype in the 'completed' state is the actual collection method.
            
            Other complementary archetypes will carry the detail about 'Specimen container', 'Specimen preparation', and 'Specimen transport'.
            
            This archetype has been designed to be used with the Specimen container archetype in two main ways: 
            - 'Specimen container' nested within 'Specimen' (for example when a venous blood specimen is divided between two vials, or a whole large intestine is divided into three buckets); or
            - 'Specimen' nested within 'Specimen container' (for example when a bucket of formalin contains a section of large intestine and a rectum, or a jar contains five individually marked moles).
            
            Please note: The term 'collection' used in this archetype always refers to the activity of obtaining a specimen from an individual. It is not intended to represent the transport of the specimen from the individual to the testing laboratory.">
