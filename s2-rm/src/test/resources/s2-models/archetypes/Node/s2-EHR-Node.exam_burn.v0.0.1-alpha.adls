            use = <"Use to record a narrative description of the overall findings observed during the physical examination of an identified burn. This initial draft archetype consists only of the core examination pattern data Nodes (as per Node.exam_pattern) and will likely be expanded further over time as specific clinical requirements are identified.
            
            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination findings' SLOT within the Node.exam_skin archetype or the OBSERVATION.exam, but can also be used within any other OBSERVATION or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate - for example, Node.exam_breast.
            
            Use to provide a framework in which Node archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings. 
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data Node.">

            Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom.
            
            Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations or measurements or test results - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure or OBSERVATION.imaging_exam.">
