            This archetype has been designed to be nested in the 'Test result' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result archetype. It is intended to provide a consistent framework for nesting any specific genomic variant Node archetype within the 'Structured variant' SLOT.
            
            This archetype allows the recording of genomic variants in both the HGVS syntax in an inline parsable Node, and an atomic, structured form through the use of a nested Node archetype for specific variant types. If both of those representations are used simultaneously, they need to represent identical data.">
