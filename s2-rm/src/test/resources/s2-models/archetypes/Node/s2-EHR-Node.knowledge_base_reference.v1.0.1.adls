            This archetype is intended to be nested within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, as clinically appropriate. For example, it may be used within the Node.genomic_variant_result archetype in one of three places - to record details about the 'Bioinformatics analysis workflow'; 'Predicted impact analysis'; and 'Population allele frequency'.">
