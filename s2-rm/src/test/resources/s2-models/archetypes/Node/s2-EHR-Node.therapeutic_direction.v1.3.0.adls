			purpose = <"To record structured details of a single therapeutic direction for an ordered therapeutic/prescribable item.
            
            Each direction generally applies for a given duration, or fixed number of administrations.">
			use = <"A direction describes one or more sequential therapeutic administration patterns, coupled with an overall direction duration and details of any repetitive pattern of intended administration outside a single day.
            
            For example: '1 tab in the morning, 1 tab at night, for 3 weeks, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays'. This Node allows multiple occurrences to enable representation of a complete set of dosage directions for a single medication order. The Node can be renamed in template or at run-time to represent a specific dosing event such as 'loading dose', 'bolus'.
            
            This archetype will generally be used in the context of a parent INSTRUCTION archetype. It has been specifically designed for use within a complex Medication order including IV medication, or for fluid orders in the context of transfusion or dialysis.">
