            The intended scope for this archetype is to eventually record all detailed findings on radiological examination of the uterus using any modality. It is anticipated that further data Nodes may be added as requirements are identified and confirmed.
            
            This archetype is designed to be nested within the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate. Use to provide a framework in which Node archetypes can be nested in appropriate SLOTs: 
            - Details about the imaging examination of one or more gestations will be recorded using the 'Pregnancy findings' SLOT; 
            - Details about the imaging examination of the uterine cervix will be recorded within the 'Cervical findings' SLOT; 
            - Details about the imaging examination an intrauterine device (IUD) will be recorded within the 'IUD findings' SLOT; and
            - Details about other imaging findings such as structural abnormalities or lesions will be recorded using the 'Additional findings' SLOT.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record imaging examination findings for any body structure or region other than the uterus. Use other archetypes from the Node.imaging_exam family for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record details related to the overall findings, context or technical details related to a complete imaging examination test result. Use the OBERSERVATION.imaging_exam_result for this purpose. For example, comments on the study quality, differential diagnoses, and overall impression.">
