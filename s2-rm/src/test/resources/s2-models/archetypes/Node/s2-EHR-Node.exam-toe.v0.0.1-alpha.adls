            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam or the 'Procedure detail' SLOT within ACTION.procedure archetype, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            Use to provide a framework in which Node archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data Node.">
