            This archetype is intended to be used to represent a range of widely used different severity rating scales, such as visual analogue scale, or different ranges of numerical rating scales.
            
            Severity can be rated by the individual by recording a score, for example from 0 (not present) to 10.0 (as severe as the individual can imagine).">
			keywords = <"numeric rating scale", "visual analogue scale", "rating scale", "severity">
			misuse = <"Not to be used in established rating scales such as Clinical Frailty Scale and Glasgow Coma Scale. Use an archetype specific for the rating scale for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used for verbal rating scales and graphic rating scales, because they are usually tailored to the specific rated concept.
            
            Not to be used for ratings where the scale is inverted, for example where 10 is the least severe and 0 is the most severe.">
