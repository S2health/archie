            In some circumstances this archetype may be carried within a Node.laboratory_test_panel archetype, together with other analytes which are normally tested and/or reported as part of a battery, panel or profile. 
            
            This archetype may be used within the setting of more complex laboratory/pathology reporting such as anatomical pathology reports where quantitative results such as cytometric flow studies are often reported alongside conventional macroscopic and microscopic reporting.">
