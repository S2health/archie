            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the Node.exam-eye or OBSERVATION.exam archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data Node.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom_sign.">
