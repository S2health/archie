			use = <"Use to record details of an organization as they are known or understood in the course of clinical documentation, often ad hoc or when it is not appropriate or possible to use a formal demographic register or index. Examples include:
            - the copyholder of an advanced care record, using the 'Copyholder' SLOT within the EVALUATION.advance_care_directive archetype; or
            - the name and contact details of an organization providing home care to an individual.
            
            This archetype has been designed to carry details of formally recognised entities, such as a registered business, a hospital and its recognised 'sub-organizations', such as an operationally separate or specialised satellite clinic or home care service. It may also be used to carry contact information about more informal networks or groups, such as a local community support group.
            
            This archetype could also be used as a proxy for formal demographic data when reviewing a template with domain experts - for example, an assessment where reviewers would expect to see an organizations' details on an assessment form.">
