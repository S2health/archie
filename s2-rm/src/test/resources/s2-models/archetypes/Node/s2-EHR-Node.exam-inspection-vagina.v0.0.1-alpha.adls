            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the Node.exam-vulva or OBSERVATION.exam archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            Use to provide a framework in which Node archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings - for example, inspection of the cervix.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data Node.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record details about the palpation of the vagina - for example, as part of a bimanual vaginal examination. Use Node.exam-palpation-vagina for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used when multiple modes are used simultaneously to examine a body system or anatomical structure, including palpation or auscultation. Use the Node.exam family of archetypes for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom_sign.">
