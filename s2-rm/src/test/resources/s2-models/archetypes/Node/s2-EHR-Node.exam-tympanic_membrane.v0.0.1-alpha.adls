            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the Node.exam-external_auditory_canal or OBSERVATION.exam archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            Use to provide a framework in which Node archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings - for example, the middle ear or the Tos or Sade classifications for retraction.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data Node.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording data not related to other parts of the ear such as the external ear or middle ear - use the specific archetypes, Node.exam-ear and Node.exam-middle_ear.
            
            Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom_sign.">
