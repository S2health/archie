            The scope of this archetype is inclusive of all occupations or activities undertaken by an individual. For example: a paid job or employment; unpaid work of any type such as a volunteer position; or roles such as being retired or a student. 
            
            Multiple instances of this archetype captured over time will result in the aggregation of a history of past and present jobs and/or roles.
            
            An active, or current occupation may be implied from a 'Date commenced' but no 'Date ceased'. 
            
            An individual may carry out many simultaneous occupations, each of which may be paid or unpaid. Each occupation should be recorded in a separate instance of this archetype.
            
            If occupation attributes change significantly, such as a change of role/title or number of hours, then this should be recorded as a separate instance of this archetype.
            
            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Occupation episode' SLOT within the EVALUATION.occupation_summary archetype, but can also be used within any other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            There may be some apparent or real overlap between the data Nodes in this archetype and occupation/employment details that may be stored as demographic details in clinical or administrative systems. These data Nodes have been designed specifically to support clinical purposes including generation of a medical certificate to a current employer.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record temporary changes or episodes within a single occupation record, such as being on leave. This is out of scope for this archetype and should be part of an employer's human relations system.
            
            Not to be used for detailed descriptions of health risks or exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace. Use the archetypes EVALUATION.health_risk or EVALUATION.exposure for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record information about sources of income or income details for the individual. Use the EVALUATION.income_summary archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record information about the occupation of an individual at a specific point in time (for example, on June 16, 2014) or during a relative interval of time (for example 'in the past 30 days'. Use an appropriate OBSERVATION archetype for this purpose.">
