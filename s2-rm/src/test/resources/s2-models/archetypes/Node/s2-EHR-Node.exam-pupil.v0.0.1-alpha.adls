            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam, Node.exam-eye or Node.exam-cranial_nerves archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            Use to provide a framework in which Node archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
