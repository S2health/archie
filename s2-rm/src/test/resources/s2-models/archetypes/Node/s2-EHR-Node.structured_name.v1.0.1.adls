			purpose = <"To record details about the structured name of an individual as they are known or understood in the course of clinical documentation.">
			use = <"Use to record details about the structured name of an individual as they are known or understood in the course of clinical documentation, often ad hoc or when it is not appropriate or possible to use a formal demographic register or index.
            
            In most simple clinical recording use cases, the unstructured 'Name' Node within the Node.person archetype will be sufficient to record the name of an individual as part of a health record. However, in circumstances where a structured name is necessary or desirable for clinical recording purposes, nest this archetype within the 'Structured name' SLOT in Node.person archetype.
            
            Each data Node can be entered as a string of free text - for example, 'Prof Dr', 'Sonja Jane', 'Smith-Brown', 'MP'. Alternatively, as each data Node is repeatable within a template:
            - 'Title' could be cloned to 'Title 1' for the value 'Prof' and 'Title 2' for the value 'Dr'; and
            -  'Given name' could be cloned and renamed to 'First name' for the value 'Sonja' and 'Middle name' for the value 'Jane'.
            
            While this archetype has been aligned with ISO 22220, preferred name, name usage, valid dates and the repeating Name component/Order grouping has intentionally not been replicated due to the reduced scope of this archetype.
            
            It is anticipated that in most use cases for which this archetype has been designed, complex family names will simply be recorded as a string. However, it is possible to record them with more granularity and within this structured name pattern using guidance and examples from ISO 22220:2007 (Annex F), including:
            - Family name first, given name/s last;
            - Family names with prefixes eg El Haddad or van der Heyden; and
            - Names containing both father's and mother's family names.">
