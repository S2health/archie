            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used as the framework for recording details about examination of urine, with the context of the anatomical site or source of the urine will be carried in the archetypes in which it is nested, including but not limited to:
            - in the 'Examination findings' SLOT within many of the Node.exam family of archetypes and related inspection archetypes;
            - in the 'Physical properties' SLOT within the Node.specimen archetype;
            - in the 'Additional details' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.urinalysis, the OBSERVATION.fluid_output archetypes; and
            - within other OBSERVATION or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
            
            While this archetype will most likely be used in the context of a living subject, it is also appropriate to use in recording autopsy findings.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical description' data Node.">

            Not to be used to record the inspection of blood or blood clots, but only to record the presence of blood or blood clots within urine.
            
            Not to be used for recording measurements of urine output - use OBSERVATION archetypes for this purpose. For example: OBSERVATION.fluid_output.
            
            Not to be used to record details about a non-physiological fluid.
            
            Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes. For example: OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom_sign.
            
            Not to be used to record the results of a urinalysis test - use OBSERVATION.urinalysis for this purpose.">
