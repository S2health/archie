            This archetype has been designed to be nested inside an ENTRY archetype which will provide a clinical context and the tumour type for the TNM record - for example: the 'Specific details' SLOT within the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype.
            
            Each cancer has a set of unique TNM classification values. It is expected that this archetype will be further constrained to reflect the unique requirements for each tumour and edition of the TNM classification, using either an archetype specialisation or a template.
            
            With certain types of tumours, such as Hodgkin and other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, a different system for designating the extent of disease and prognosis is used. In these circumstances only the stage group is defined.">
