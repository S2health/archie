			purpose = <"To record details about the processing of a specimen collected from, or related to, an individual for further analysis, preservation or storage.">
			use = <"To record details about the processing or preparation of a specimen for analysis, preservation or storage, including specific processes such as fixation, smearing, paraffin embedding, centrifuging, washing, sectioning, acidification, incubation and staining.
            
            The terms 'preparation' and 'processing' are sometimes used interchangeably and sometimes to describe specific steps performed on the specimen between collection and analysis. This archetype is intended to be used to describe all the relevant steps performed, but for simplicity uses the term 'processing' to cover both.
            
            The archetype has been designed to be nested within the Node.specimen archetype and to record the details about a single process step OR a multistep process. If there is only one process or step, then use the data Nodes at root level. If there is a multistep process, each separate step can be represented using a separate instance of the 'Process activity' internal Node which contains one instance of this same Node.specimen_processing for each process step.">
