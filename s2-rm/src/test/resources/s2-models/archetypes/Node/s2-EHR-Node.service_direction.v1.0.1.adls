            This archetype has been designed to be nested within the 'Complex timing' SLOT in the INSTRUCTION.service_request archetype, but may be used within other clinically relevant archetypes, as required. Multiple instances of this archetype may be required to represent a complex order for services, especially ones with changing frequency or patterns of delivery over time.
            
            Each service direction provides detailed guidance about one or more sequential activities, each comprising an amount and an intradaily timing, together with an overall direction duration and details of any repetitive pattern outside a single day. Each activity pair allows for a complex intradaily pattern to be described, such as 2 hours of nursing assistance in the morning and one hour in the evening.
            
            Each service direction may apply for a fixed duration of time, or fixed number of services, which is specified using the 'Total amount' data Node.
            
            The total amount for the entire service request, is recorded in the INSTRUCTION.service_request.
            
            For example: 
            - 'Home nursing assistance for 2 hours in the morning and 1 hour in the evening for a period of 6 weeks, followed by 1 hour in the morning only for a further 6 weeks';
            - 'Dialysis blood test package to be carried out: The second Wednesday of the month in January, March, May, July, September and November';
            - 'INR daily for one week, weekly for one month, monthly for six months'; or
            - 'Vital signs observations every hour for four hours, then every two hours for 12 hours'.
            
            The Node can be renamed in template or at run-time to represent a specific service direction such as 'First four hours after surgery'.">
