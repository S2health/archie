            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam or the \\\"Procedure detail\\\" SLOT within the ACTION.procedure archetype, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate. 
            Interpretation of the findings, for example 'No abnormality detected', can be recorded using the 'Clinical interpretation' data Node.
            
            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
            
            The intended scope for this archetype is to eventually record all detailed findings on physical examination of the hip joint. It is anticipated that further data Nodes may be added as requirements are identified and confirmed.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data Node.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom_sign.
            
            Not to be used for recording the results of an imaging examination - use the Node.imaging_exam family of archetypes for this purpose.">
