            This archetype is intended to be nested within the 'Transportation details' SLOT in any archetypes where it is context- & content-appropriate. 
            
            In addition, it is possible to record fine details about each phase of a multi-step transportation process by nesting this archetype, one instance per step, within the 'Transportation step' SLOT within this archetype.
            
            Example use cases include, but are not limited to:
            - within the INSTRUCTION.service_request to describe the required transportation for a specimen, specimen container or biological specimen such as a donated organ.
            - within a laboratory-related ACTION archetype to describe how a specimen or specimen container has been transported, particularly where this is relevant to potential issues with the quality of the specimen for analysis.
            - within OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result to record details of the specimen or container transportation.">
