            This archetype is intended to be used within the COMPOSITION.adverse_reaction_list or as one component of other COMPOSITION archetypes. For example: complex documents, such as a discharge summary or referral.
            
            This list can be comprised of three types of statements, each represented by specific archetypes:
            - statements about the positive presence of adverse reactions can be recorded using multiple instances of the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk, one instance of the archetype per substance; OR
            - statements about the positive exclusion of adverse reactions can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion-global  - for example: 'No known adverse reactions'; OR
            - statements about no information being available - neither a positive presence of adverse reactions nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.">
