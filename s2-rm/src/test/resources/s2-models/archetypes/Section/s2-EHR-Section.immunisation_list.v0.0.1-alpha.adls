            This archetype is intended to be used within the COMPOSITION.vaccination_list or as one component of other COMPOSITION archetypes. For example: complex documents, such as a referral.
            
            This list can be comprised of three types of statements, each represented by specific archetypes:
            - statements about the positive presence of vaccinations administered are recorded using the ACTION.medication OR
            - statements about the positive exclusion of vaccinations administered can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion-global; OR
            - statements about no information being available - neither a positive presence of an administered vaccination nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.">
			keywords = <"immunisation", "vaccination", "exclusion", "absence", "list">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the actual administration of a vaccination. Use ACTION.medication for this purpose.">
