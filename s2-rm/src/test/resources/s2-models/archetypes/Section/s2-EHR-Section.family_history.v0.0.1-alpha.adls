            This archetype is intended to be used within the COMPOSITION.family_history or as one component of other COMPOSITION archetypes. For example: complex documents, such as a discharge summary or referral.
            
            This list can be comprised of three types of statements, each represented by specific archetypes:
            - a statement about the positive presence of family history issues can be recorded using a single instance of the EVALUATION.family_history; OR
            - statements about the positive exclusion of family history issues can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion-global ; OR
            - statements about no information being available - neither a positive presence of family history issues nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.">
