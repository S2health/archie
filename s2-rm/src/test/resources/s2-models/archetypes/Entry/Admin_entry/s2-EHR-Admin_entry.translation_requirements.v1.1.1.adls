            This archetype is intended to support logistics within the local clinical information system. It may not be appropriate to exchange this content with another clinical system in another location. If there is more than one administrative language a separate assessment should be made of the need for translation of each language. A new instance of this archetype should be created for each administration language.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record details about the practical ability of an individual to communicate, including impairments and need for communication aids - use EVALUATION.communication_capability for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record details about a language - use Node.language for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record details about a request for interpreter services - use Node.Interpreter_requirements nested within a suitable INSTRUCTION archetype, for example INSTRUCTION.service_request.
            
            Not to be used to record details about an interpretation that was performed - use the proposed ACTION.interpretation.">
