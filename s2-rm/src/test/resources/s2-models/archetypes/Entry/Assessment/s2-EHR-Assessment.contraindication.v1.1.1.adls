			purpose = <"To record a contraindication for a clinical intervention (including, but not limited to, a treatment, test or procedure) that should not be carried out due to the likelihood, or possibility, of harm being caused to an individual.">
			use = <"To record a contraindication for a clinical intervention in the health record of an individual due to the likelihood, or possibility, of causing harm to the individual if the identified intervention is carried out. 
            
            This archetype may also be used to record a contraindication for a clinical intervention in the health record of the individual, even though the resulting clinical effect may cause harm to others and not directly on the individual. For example: administration of live vaccines should be contraindicated in an individual who has a family member in an immunosuppressed state or actively taking immunosuppressive therapy, as that family member may be at significant risk of contracting the infectious disease. 
            
            This archetype should be regarded as a critical archetype by any clinical decision support system testing for any relevant therapeutic precautions as a clinician commences a new clinical Intervention for an individual.
            
            This contraindication may be identified in a number of ways including, but not limited to: 
            - previous experience of a procedure being performed and subsequent clinical assessment that this should not be repeated; 
            - implantation of a metal device which precludes some imaging examinations
            - genomic test results that indicate an adverse event may take place if a treatment or medication is administered; or
            - adverse experience by a family member to a similar treatment, medication or procedure.
            
            In the case of medications or vaccines, this archetype complements the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk archetype by identifying other reasons why a medication or vaccine should not be administered, other than an adverse reaction. In view of this, clinical decision support for prescribing should include reference to this archetype plus the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk as part of a safe prescribing process.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the occurrence of an adverse reaction to a substance or agent. Adverse reaction risk is a very specific type of contradiction and because of its ubiquity has been modelled separately as EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record a condition or state of the individual that is clinically significant and unique or idiosyncratic for this individual, and is considered vital information when making treatment decisions. Use EVALUATION.precaution for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record personal preferences of the individual. Use specific archetypes for this purpose.">
