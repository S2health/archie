            Data recorded using this archetype is intended to be revised and updated after each pregnancy, either manually by a clinician or automatically calculated within a clinical system. It is anticipated that this archetype represents only one component of an obstetric history. A complete obstetric history should be represented using multiple archetypes within a template.
            
            In order to record a TPAL overview, Term Births (T), Preterm Births (P) and Abortions (A) can be recorded using this archetype. Living Children (L) can be recorded using the EVALUATION.social_network archetype, so that it can be used more broadly. Some variants may also use Gravidity (G) and the number of Multiple Births (M). 
            
            In many jurisdictions, the definition of some of these data Nodes may vary. For this reason, definitions may be included in the Protocol to ensure clarity of intent especially if the data is being exchanged between jurisdictions.">

			misuse = <"Not for recording summary information about a single pregnancy. Use specific archetypes for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record details about procedures performed during a pregnancy, for example terminations or deliveries. Use the ACTION.procedure archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the details about findings in each antenatal visits or during labour. Detailed data should be recorded using appropriate archetypes for this purpose such as OBSERVATION.story together with Node.symptom_sign; OBSERVATION.blood pressure; OBSERVATION.urinalysis; or EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis.">
