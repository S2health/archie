The decisions will support clinicians by providing guidance regarding possible treatments, activities, and diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that may be life-saving, life-prolonging or cause undesirable side effects. 
            
            This archetype is intended to be used as part of integrated care or end-of-life planning, and not as a reaction to an acute or emergency situation. Each decision should be made in response to the individual's overall health and general circumstances, and usually asserted by a clinician after consideration of the individual's advance care directives or stated preferences.
            
            It may be necessary to record temporary overrides to usual advance intervention decisions in specific circumstances, for example during pregnancy or preoperatively. In this situation it will be necessary to record a separate instance of this archetype, using a combination of relevant validity and review dates.">
