            Advance care directive may also be known as living will, advance directive, advance decision, advance decision to refuse treatment, personal directive, advance healthcare directive, or medical directive. An advance care directive is commonly used to refuse life-sustaining treatment which may include, but is not limited to: cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); clinically assisted nutrition and hydration; assisted ventilation; and antibiotics for life-threatening infections. It could also include positive preferences and instructions for future health care priorities, living arrangements and personal matters. An individual with capacity may create an advance care directive to record their preferences for medical care and treatment in advance, which is intended to guide decision-making in future situations in which the individual is unable to make or communicate decisions. 
            
            This archetype has been specifically designed as a framework or structure that can be extended for the complex range of use cases and local requirements by nesting a variety of possible Node archetypes which will contain specific details as per national or other local requirements. 
            
            In some countries, an advance care directive is legally persuasive without having an official legal status. In others it is a legally-binding document, and it MUST be ensured that the advance care directive archetype and any nested archetypes adhere to relevant legal requirements.">
