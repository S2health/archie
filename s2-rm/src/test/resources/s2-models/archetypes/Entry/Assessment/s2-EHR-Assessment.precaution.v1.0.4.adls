            This archetype should be regarded as a critical archetype by any clinical decision support system testing for any relevant therapeutic precautions as a clinician commences a new clinical intervention for an individual. 
            
            Examples of conditions that warrant creation of a precaution include, but are not limited to:
            - Immunosuppressed/on immunosuppressive therapy – linked to medication order for chemo or steroids; or diagnosis of leukaemia;
            - Renal failure – linked to renal function tests and/or a formal diagnosis of renal failure;
            - Waiting for organ transplant;
            - Undergoing a regular treatment such as radiation therapy or dialysis;
            - Transplanted organ or metal implant in situ;
            - Ongoing investigation or follow up of suspected or verified malignant disease;
            - Participation in a pharmacological trial; or
            - Using anticoagulant treatment.">
