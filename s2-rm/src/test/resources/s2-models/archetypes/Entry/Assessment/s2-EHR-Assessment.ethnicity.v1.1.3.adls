            Ethnicity is a concept that is frequently used inconsistently, such that existing or legacy data may be quite varied in content, including but not limited to:
            - A long-shared history (written or oral);
            - A cultural tradition, including family, social and religious customs;
            - A common geographic origin;
            - A common language; or
            - A minority or distinct group within the local community context.
            
            In designing this archetype, the structure has deliberately been kept simple, to support any and all requirements for representing ethnicity. As the understanding around ethnicity and appropriate value sets are identified and agreed upon, this archetype may grow to support evolving clarity of requirements. The data Node 'Ethnicity' allows multiple occurrences so that more than one ethnic and cultural identity to be recorded for the individual from a single value set, and also so that more than one representation of 'Ethnicity' can be recorded, for example explicitly recording First People status.
            
            The 'Ancestry' data Node has also been included to support health risk assessment related to family history and inherited disease, such as a genetic variations that increase the risk of Crohn's disease in Ashkenazi Jews. 
            
            The amount of overlap between 'Ethnicity' and 'Ancestry may vary enormously between individuals, but separating each into distinct data Nodes will allow appropriate usage within the clinical context for decision support and provision of healthcare.
            
            This archetype has been designed to be recorded as a single instance within a health record, persisted, updated and revised over time as a new version.
            
            Ethnicity is often considered as a component of a demographic record for an individual however it has been represented within this clinical archetype for situations when it needs to be represented in a clinical data collection or is required to support culturally sensitive and appropriate healthcare delivery, for example in First Nations communities.
            
            The concept of categorisation by race or skin colour is controversial. In some places, the term 'race' may be considered acceptable and interchangeable with 'ethnicity', yet is illegal in others. Contributing to the confusion, many value sets for ethnicity also contain values that describe physical characteristics such as skin colour or geographical origin. The concept of 'Race' may sometimes be used as a clumsy proxy for identifying risk factors related to social determinants of health (SDOH), however it is strongly recommended that archetypes that represent SDOH concepts be used for more accurate data capture.">
