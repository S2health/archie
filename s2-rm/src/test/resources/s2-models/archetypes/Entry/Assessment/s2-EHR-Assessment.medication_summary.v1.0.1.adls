            This archetype has been designed to represent an overview of the use of medication only in specific situations where it adds value to the health record, such as where the cumulative dose of the medication has significant toxic effects or long term use has adverse health impacts. A single instance of the archetype will be used to capture one or more episodes of use, so that a pattern of use can be identified and/or a cumulative dose can be calculated.
             
            Examples of use include:
            - monitoring of the cumulative dose of doxorubicin or methotrexate taken over a lifetime.
            - monitoring the duration of high dose bisphosphanates.
            - monitoring the use of an experimental medication in a trial.
             
            Use a new instance of this archetype to record details about each medication or group or class of medications.
             
            Triggers for closing one episode and commencing a new one will largely reflect local data collection preferences and clinical priorities, including if the individual:
            - stops using the medication for a significant period of time (which will likely be locally defined).
            - significantly changes their amount or pattern of use.
            - changes in the route by which the medication was administered.">
