            The intent of this archetype is to support a clinical determination about whether the individual is up-to-date with vaccinations for the targeted disease/s or agent/s. It is not intended to make a determination about the immunisation status, which is about whether the individual has developed an adequate immune response following vaccination or whether protective immunity has waned. 
            
            This archetype does not presume any particular schedule or protocol for immunisation.">

            Not to be used for documenting the detailed administration of a vaccine, including body site, route, manufacturer and batch number etc - use Action.vaccination or Action.medication for this purpose.
