            This archetype has been specifically designed to make a clear and unambiguous statement of an overall exclusion of a type of clinical item from the health record. This approach is used in preference to relying on flags or terminology to express negation.
            
            Each global statement should be recorded in a separate instance - for example a separate instance for a statement about medications and another for adverse reactions.
            
            The 'Global statement' data Node allows for recording of a single Global statement. The different Global statements listed in the \\\"Global statement' run-time name constraint identifies the the different global exclusions. This name constraint can be applied during template modelling or at run-time within a software application.
            
            Please note that exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the point-in-time of recording. It is possible for a record to be able to state that an individual has NO KNOWN history of any problems or diagnoses (using an exclusion statement) at the same consultation as recording the evidence of their first experience of a problem or diagnosis (using the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype). In future record statements, the individual may have a KNOWN history of the problem or diagnosis recorded in their problem list.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record the exclusion of a specific problem/diagnosis, medication, procedure, family history, adverse reaction or other clinical item - use the EVALUATION.exclusion_specific archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the exclusion of any component of a physical examination - use the Node.exclusion_exam archetype within an appropriate OBSERVATION or Node archetype.
            
            Not to be used to record the exclusion of symptoms use the Node.exclusion_symptom archetype within an appropriate OBSERVATION or Node archetype.
            
            Not to be used to record the absence of information - use the EVALUATION.absense archetype for this purpose.">
