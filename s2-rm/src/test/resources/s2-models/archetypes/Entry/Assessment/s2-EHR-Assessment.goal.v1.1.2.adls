            This archetype is intended for use as a component of a care plan, COMPOSITION.care_plan, and will be versioned over time as any changes are made. For example, if a new goal is added to a care plan, or or any other change made, the data will be added/updated and the Care plan saved as a new version. It can be used in any other COMPOSITION or SECTION archetypes, where clinically relevant.">
