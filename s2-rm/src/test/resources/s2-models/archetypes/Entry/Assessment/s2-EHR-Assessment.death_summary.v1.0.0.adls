            This archetype has been designed to carry the details about the death of an individual that only need to be recorded once within a health record, including, but not limited to:
            - the date and time of death;
            - the place of death, as a category, named place or an address; 
            - context about the death of a mother giving birth;
            - context about the death of a newborn; and
            - manner and circumstances related to the death.
            
            It is anticipated that one or more data Nodes in this archetype may be used in the following use cases:
            - Death certificate - date/time of death and location of death;
            - Post mortem report - describing known circumstances related to the death, including information related to maternal, fetal or neonatal death.
            - Disease registries.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record information about the formal cause(s) of death - use EVALUATION.cause_of_death for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record information about post-mortem examination findings such as lividity or rigor mortis - use appropriate examination-related findings within the COMPOSITION.report-post_mortem container archetype.
