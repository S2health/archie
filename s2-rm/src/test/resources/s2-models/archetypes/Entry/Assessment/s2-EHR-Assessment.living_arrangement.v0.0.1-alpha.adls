            This archetype has been designed as one of a family of archetypes that describe the social connectedness of an individual in their home environment.
            
            Within this archetype, the intent of the concept of 'household' is to capture information about one or more people who reside together, including sharing meals, economic resources and/or living space. In this context, a single household might comprise varieties of blended families, a student share house, a group home, or a single person living alone. A single dwelling may be considered to contain multiple households if they don't share meals or resources, or have separate living spaces.">
