			use = <"Use to record a summary of medical devices that have been fitted or implanted including, but not limited to:
            - assisted hearing devices, such as hearing aids or auditory implants;
            - orthotics or artificial limbs; 
            - dentures or dental implants; and
            - eyeglasses or contact lenses.
            
            This archetype has been specifically designed to assist in providing an overview of management of medical devices over time. It may be used to share as a summary within messages or between clinical systems, where the detail is not required. If specific devices have been used in the past, as much detail as is available can be added in this archetype to create a context which may influence decisions about current or future devices of the same type.
            
            In practice, some clinical systems will need to record specific and detailed INSTRUCTION and ACTION archetypes to reflect the request for an medical device and subseqent activities that need to be recorded as that request is carried out. It is inevitable that there will be some overlap in this summary and these detailed archetypes. All are neccessary in various situations. 
            
            If clinicians are recording the process of request and provision of medical devices, then this summary should be derived from those recordings, to ensure that there is no duplication of clinical input.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to request a medical device - use the INSTRUCTION.request family for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the activities that occur in the planning and fitting of a device - use the ACTION.device_fitting archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the activities that occur in the planning and fitting of an implant - use the ACTION.procedure archetype for this purpose.">
