			use = <"Use to record the disease for an identified infectious disease as part of a disease surveillance investigation, most commonly the final determination at the completion of a case investigation but may also record initial classification as a suspected infection.
            
            Use a separate instance of this archetype to record the conclusion for each suspected 'Index disease'. For example in a fever & rash investigation, considering Measles and Rubella as the potential causes, use one instance of this archetype to record the conclusion, rationale, evidence etc related to Measles, and another to carry the information related to Rubella.">
