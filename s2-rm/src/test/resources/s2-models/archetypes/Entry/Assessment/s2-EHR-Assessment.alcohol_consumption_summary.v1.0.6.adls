            This archetype is to be used to record information about both current and previous alcohol consumption.
            
            The specific scope of this archetype is about documentation about all types of alcohol consumed or ingested by an individual, because of the associated health risks.
            
            The history of waxing and waning of consumption for each type of alcohol over time can be captured using the repeatable 'Per episode' Node. 
            
            Triggers for closing one episode and commencing a new one will largely reflect local data collection preferences, including if the individual: 
            - quits for a significant period of time (which will likely be locally defined); or
            - significantly changes the amount or the pattern of alcohol consumption.
            
            The 'Per type' Node of data Nodes allows for recording of specific details about each type of alcohol consumed, and can be repeated for every type alcoholic beverage consumed in the actual episode.  The Node 'Type' identifies the type of alcohol, either as a free text or coded text with a defined valueset.
            
            In many situations the individual will only consume one type of alcohol, such as beer. If other types of alcohol are consumed, the details will be recorded in another instance of the 'Per type' Node.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of alcohol consumption within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Overall description' data Node.">
