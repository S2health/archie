            This archetype is to be used to record information about both current and previous use of smokeless tobacco.
            
            The specific scope of this archetype includes the use of all types of smokeless tobacco because of the associated health risks. Amount of nicotine, as well as use of bags and additives has been left outside of scope for the core archetype, but could be added into the 'Type details' SLOT if required. 
            
            The 'Per type' Node of data Nodes allows for recording of specific details and episodes about each type of tobacco used and can be repeated once per type.
            
            In many situations the individual will only use one type of smokeless tobacco, such as snus or snuff. If other types of tobacco are used the details will be recorded in another instance of the 'Per type' Node.
            
            The history of varying use for each type of tobacco over time can be captured using the repeatable 'Per episode' Node. This Node of data Nodes allows for a very detailed pattern of tobacco usage behaviour to be recorded for each type of tobacco used such as daily usage of snus, alongside occasional use of chewing tobacco while on holiday. 
            
            Triggers for closing one episode and commencing a new one will largely reflect local data collection preferences, including if the individual: 
            - quits for a significant period of time (which will likely be locally defined); or
            - significantly changes their amount of use or pattern of their usage.
            
            To incorporate narrative descriptions of smokeless tobacco usage habits within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, use the 'Overall description' data Node.">
