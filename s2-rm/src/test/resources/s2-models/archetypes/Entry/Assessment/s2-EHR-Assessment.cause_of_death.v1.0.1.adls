            Examples of use cases include, but are not limited to:
            - a death certificate or notification, nested within the COMPOSITION.certificate archetype;
            - a post mortem report, nested within the COMPOSITION.report-post_mortem archetype, as one of a number of components of a post mortem report; or
            - disease registries and epidemiological surveillance, nested within the COMPOSITION.report-case_investigation archetype, as one of a number of components of a case investigation, such as a maternal mortality investigation.
            
            Example 1:
            - Cerebral haemorrhage (as 'Direct cause', A) 
            -- 'due to' Metastasis of the brain (as 'Antecedent cause B');
            -- 'due to' Breast cancer (as the earliest 'Antecedent cause C'). As Breast cancer is the earliest recorded antecedent cause, this condition may also be known as the 'Underlying cause'.
            
            Example 2: 
            - Pulmonary embolus (as 'Direct cause', A) 
            -- 'due to' Fractured femur (as 'Antecedent cause B')
            -- 'due to' Accidental fall (as 'Antecedent/Underlying cause C').">
