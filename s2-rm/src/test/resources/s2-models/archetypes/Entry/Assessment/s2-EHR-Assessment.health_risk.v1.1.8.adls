			purpose = <"To record known risk factors for an identified disease, condition, or other potentially adverse health issue, and/or an evaluation of the likelihood of the individual experiencing it in the future.
            
            This archetype has been deliberately left open and broad in scope. The 'Health Risk' could be determined from risk factors from any or all of: medical; biomarker; lifestyle; social; occupational hazard; or environmental domains.
            
            The intent of this archetype is to document potential risk at a point in time, and to support decision-making that may reduce the identified risk, whether by clinicians or the individual themselves.">
			use = <"Use to record known risk factors for an identified disease, condition, or other potentially adverse health issue, and/or an evaluation of the likelihood of the individual experiencing it in the future.
            
            As risk factors may be gradually identified over time and the overall risk reassessed as a result, the 'Date identified' will record the date on which each risk factor has been identified and the 'Last updated' data Node will record the last time that the whole assessment was updated.">
