            This archetype has been specifically designed to make a clear and unambiguous statement of a specific exclusion of a type of clinical item from the health record. This approach is used in preference to relying on flags or terminology to express negation.
            
            The data Node 'Excluded concept' allows for recording of a single specific statement. The different specific concepts listed in the \\\"Excluded concept' run-time name constraint identifies the different specific exclusions. This name constraint can be applied during template modelling or at run-time within a software application.
            
            Each specific exclusion should be recorded in a separate instance of this archetype. For example: record 'no past history of adverse reaction to penicillin V', 'no past history of adverse reaction to cephalosporins' and 'no known family history of heart disease' in 3 separately constrained instances of this archetype.
            
            Please note that exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the point-in-time of recording. It is possible for a record to be able to state that an individual has NO KNOWN history of a specific problem or diagnosis (using an exclusion statement) at the same consultation as recording the evidence of their first experience of the same problem or diagnosis (using the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype). In future record statements, the individual may have a KNOWN history of the problem or diagnosis recorded in their problem list.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record the exclusion of all problems or diagnoses, medications, procedures, family history, adverse reactions or other clinical items - use the EVALUATION.exclusion_global archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the exclusion of any component of a physical examination - use the Node.exclusion_exam archetype within an appropriate OBSERVATION or Node archetype.
            
            Not to be used to record the exclusion of symptoms use the Node.exclusion_symptom archetype within an appropriate OBSERVATION or Node archetype.
            
            Not to be used to record the absence of information - use the EVALUATION.absense archetype for this purpose.">
