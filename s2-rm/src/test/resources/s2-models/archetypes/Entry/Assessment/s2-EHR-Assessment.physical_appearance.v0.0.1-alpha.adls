            This archetype has been designed to be used alongside the Physical examination family and other archetypes to support a detailed description of the phenotype of an individual. 
            Examples of use cases include:
            - gamete donor matching; or 
            - assisting in post-mortem identification.
            
            The initial scope of this archetype has been kept simple and it is likely that it will be extended further in the future as use cases are identified. Potential future additions for consideration have been captured in Change request CR-867.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record aspects of physical appearance which are not enduring, such as the temporary dyeing of hair.
            
            Not to be used to record measured physical characteristics, such as height, weight and body mass index. Use the specific OBSERVATION archetypes for these purposes.
            
            Not to be used to record physical characteristics that would commonly be documented as part of a physical examination, such as walking with a limp, facial palsy, alopecia, and skin depigmentation. Use specific archetypes for physical examination for these purposes, including inspection of gait and the face.
            
            Not to be used to record a photograph or image of the individual - use the Node.media_file nested within the 'Photo' SLOT in the Node.person archetype.">
