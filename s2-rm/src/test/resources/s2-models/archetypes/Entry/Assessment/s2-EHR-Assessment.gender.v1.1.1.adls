            The intent of this archetype is to record a broad range of details connected to the gender of an individual, due to modern thinking of gender as well as new knowledge of psychological, biological and social manifestations of gender.
            
            This archetype also allows the recording of, and differentiation between, legal and administrative gender.
            
            In most common use cases 'Administrative gender' will be used, as equivalent of the traditional definition of \\\"Sex\\\" in current or legacy systems.">

            Not to be used for recording genetic or chromosomal sex. Currently this is usually recorded as a laboratory test result. Formal representation of 'Genetic sex' is not yet well defined and may involve the combination of information axes, including chromosomal and receptor data, mosaic variants and diagnoses.">
