            This archetype is to be used to record information about both current and previous use of contraception.
            
            The specific scope of this archetype is on overall documentation about the use of all types of contraception, including episodes where more than one type of contraception may have been used simultaneously.
            
            The 'Per type' Node of data Nodes allows for recording of specific details and episodes about each type of contraception used and can be repeated only once per type. 
            
            In many situations the individual will use only one type of contraception at a time. However, if other types of contraception are used at the same time, the details will be recorded in another instance of the 'Per type' Node.
            
            For each type of contraception the history of use over time can be captured using the repeatable 'Per episode' Node. This Node of data Nodes allows for a very detailed pattern of contraception use to be recorded, if necessary.
            
            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of contraceptive history within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Overall description' data Node.">
