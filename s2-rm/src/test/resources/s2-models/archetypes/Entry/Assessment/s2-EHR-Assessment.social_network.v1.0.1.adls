            This archetype has been designed to be recorded as part of a single, persistent template within the health record, such that any network changes are recorded as a new or updated version of the template.
            
            The scope of this archetype includes all types of interactions, such as face-to-face or using social media, with a broad range of people including family members, friends, community members or organizations. The social network can be self-identified or documented by a carer or healthcare provider.
            
            Details about each person or organization within the individual's social network is recorded using the Node.person or Node.organization archetypes nested within the 'Network' SLOT, including their role or relationship.
            
            In most jurisdictions, there will be limitations on what is legal to record about other people within the health record. All implementations will need to consider the legal constraints relevant to using this archetype.">
