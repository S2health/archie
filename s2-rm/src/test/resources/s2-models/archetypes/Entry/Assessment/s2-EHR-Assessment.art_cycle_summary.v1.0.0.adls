            The start of a treatment cycle is triggered by the initiation of ovulation stimulation or monitoring. 
            
            The end of a treatment cycle is triggered by identifying a 'Cycle outcome':
            - the cancellation of treatment for any reason; 
            - embryo transfer;
            - the recognition that no embryo is suitable for transfer;
