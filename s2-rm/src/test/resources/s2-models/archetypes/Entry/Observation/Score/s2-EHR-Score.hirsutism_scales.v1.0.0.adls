            This archetype has been designed to be inclusive of all hirsutism scales that are associated with the original scale originally proposed by Ferriman and Gallwey which includes eleven body sites. The extended version is inclusive of all the original sites plus the sideburn area and the perineum. The modified Ferriman-Gallwey score, includes nine body sites, excluding the lower arm, lower leg, sideburn area and perineum.
