            If the numerical (0 - 10) scale is used , after being asked to grade his or her pain in a 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain) range, the number named by the child represents his or her score.
            
            If the photographic scale is used, the child must select the one picture which best represents the pain he or her is experiencing out of a collection of six pictures representing faces exhibiting increasing degrees of pain. The picture sets, as well as the conversion rule to the 0-10 numeric scale, may be downloaded from http://www.oucher.org/the_scales.html.
            
            The criteria to use either scale may be reviewed in the Oucher User's Manual, available in http://www.oucher.org/downloads/2009_Users_Manual.pdf. In general, the numeric scale should be used if the child can count to 100 by ones or tens, or if he or she can identify which of any two numbers is larger.">
