            purpose = <"To record the MSFC Score for an individual with respect to a reference population. The MSFC was developed by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s Clinical Outcomes Assessment Task Force. The MSFC Score forms a total value that correlates with the severity of the disease with respect to a reference population. In three separate tests (Timed 25-Foot Walk, Nine Hole Peg Test and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) various aspects of higher brain functions are measured. The results of these three tests are standardized into Z-scores ​​and merged into the MSFC Score.">

            use = <"Use to record the MSFC Score and the reference data set, as well as links to the measured results of the three individual tests (Timed 25-Foot Walk, Nine Hole Peg Test and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test).
            
            The MSFC Score is a computed value based on the average of each test result, adjusted to the reference population. I.e. MSFC Score = 1/3 * (Z_arm,avg. + Z_leg,avg. + Z_cognitive), where Z_x = Z-score of each test result. This score has to be computed externally, only the resulting value is to be recorded here.
            
            Use the MSFC Manual for further scoring instructions, formulas and background information.">
