			purpose = <"To identify individuals with hazardous and harmful patterns of alcohol consumption, indicators of alcohol dependence and some consequences from harmful drinking.">
			use = <"Use to record the results of the AUDIT screening test (or the AUDIT-C subset) as a means to identify individuals with hazardous and harmful patterns of alcohol consumption, indicators of alcohol dependence and some consequences from harmful drinking. The test can be administered during an oral interview or as a self-reported questionnaire.
            
            Each of the questions in the AUDIT test will be recorded as a separate data Node. For pragmatic reasons, in this archetype, each data Node is not labelled as the full question, but as a summary of the question topic. The full question to which each data Node refers is identified in the 'Description' for each data Node. For example: \\\"How often did you have six or more drinks on one occasion in the past year?\\\" is represented as the 'Bingeing' data Node.
            
            The AUDIT-C test is a shortened version of the full AUDIT test, using only the first three questions related to consumption.">
