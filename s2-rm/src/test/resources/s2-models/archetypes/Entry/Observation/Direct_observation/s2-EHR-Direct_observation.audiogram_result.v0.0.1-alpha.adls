			purpose = <"To record measurements of hearing acuity using a calibrated hearing test device, and their interpretation by a clinician.">
			use = <"Use to record measurements and related findings for a single identified test of hearing acuity, for each ear tested separately or both ears simultaneously, via air conduction and/or bone conduction, with masking when required.
            
            Use to record the interpretation of all measurements of hearing acuity for each ear or both ears if tested simultaneously, and an overall interpretation (or audiological diagnosis). 
            
            This archetype has been designed to capture hearing threshold determination for air conduction and/or bone conduction (with or without masking) for the following tests: 
            - Pure Tone Audiometry;
            - Play Audiometry;
            - Auditory Brainstem Response; and
            - Visual Reinforcement Orientation Audiometry.
            
            All of the data Nodes are recorded using a single method or protocol. If, during the test, any of the protocol parameters need to be modified, then the subsequent part of the test will need to be recorded within a separate instance of the test data, using the updated protocol parameters.">

            - Behavioural Observation Audiometry (BOA);
            - Most Comfortable Listening Level (MCL) and Uncomfortable Listening Level (UCL); and
            - Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) for any purpose other than hearing threshold determination.
            These assessments need to be recorded in specific archetypes for the purpose.">
