            Use to record the outcome of all responses to hearing screening (or Screening Outcome). 
            
            This archetype has been designed to capture screening assessment for hearing, using pass/fail criteria, for the following tests:
            - Pure Tone Audiometry;
            - Play Audiometry;
            - Automated Auditory Brainstem Response; and
            - Visual Reinforcement Orientation Audiometry.
            
            All of the data Nodes are recorded using a single method or protocol. If, during the test, any of the protocol parameters need to be modified, then the subsequent part of the test will need to be recorded within a separate instance of the test data, using the updated protocol parameters.">

            - Behavioural Observation Audiometry (BOA);

            - Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) for diagnostic purposes
            - Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE); and
            - Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE).
            These assessments need to be recorded in specific archetypes for the purpose.">
