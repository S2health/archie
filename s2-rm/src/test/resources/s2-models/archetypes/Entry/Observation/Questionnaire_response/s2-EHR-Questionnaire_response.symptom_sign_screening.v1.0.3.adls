            use = <"Use to create a framework for recording answers to pre-defined screening questions about symptoms or signs.
            
            Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
            - Systematic inquiry in any consultation, for example:
            --- Do you have headaches? Yes, No, Unknown.
            --- Have you had dizziness in the past four weeks? Yes, No, Unknown.
            - Specific questioning related to disease surveillance.
            
            The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data Node would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.
            
            The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about a symptom that has been present at any time in the past and information about a symptom within a specified time interval - for example the difference between \\\"\\\"Are you dizzy now?\\\" compared to \\\"Have you had any dizziness in the past 4 weeks?
            
            The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' Node in the Reference Model.
            
            This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies the presence of a symptom or sign, it is recommended that clinical system record and persist the specific details about the symptom or sign using the Node.symptom_sign archetype nested within the Additional details SLOT in this archetype.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record details about the presence or absence of a symptom, outside of a screening context. Use Node.symptom_sign or Node.exclusion_symptom_sign for these purposes.
            
            Not to be used to record details about a simple selection list where a question may be recorded as either \\\"present\\\" or \\\"indeterminate\\\". Use OBSERVATION.selection_list for this purpose.">
