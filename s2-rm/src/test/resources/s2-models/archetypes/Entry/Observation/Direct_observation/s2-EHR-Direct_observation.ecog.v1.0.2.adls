            - assess how a patient's disease is progressing;

            - determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. 
            
            The ECOG performance status is in the public domain therefore available for public use. For more information, contact the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Robert Comis M.D., Group Chair - http://www.ecog.org/general/perf_stat.html.">
