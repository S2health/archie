            Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
            - Systematic questioning in any consultation; or
            - Specific questioning related to chronic disease management or preventive health.
            
            In order to record the response at a specific point in time or within an interval of time, use the EVENT RM attribute.
            
            This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening process identifies a positive family problem and it is intended that the details are to be recorded and persisted as part of an ongoing health record, any further specific details about the family problem should be recorded using the EVALUATION.family_history archetype.">
