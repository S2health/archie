            Body segment measurements that are ubiquitous and, most commonly, used as part of growth charting in childhood have been modelled as unique and discrete archetypes. Rather than create an archetype for every single possible body segment measurement, the intent of this archetype is to use a common recording pattern to capture any, or all, other possible measurements between two identified body points, identified by the 'Body segment name' data Node.
            
            This measurement may be recorded and tracked over time, for example tracking child growth parameters, or used to provide insight into the shape and proportions of an individual's body for purposes of clinical, anthropometric or ergonomic assessment. It may also be used to record the measurement of abnormal clinical findings or observations in order to track the progress of a condition or disease.
            
            Common parameters that are measured between two identified points have been added to the DV_CODED_TEXT data type in the 'Body segment name' data Node. As further parameters are identified, these can be added to this list over time.">

            - for Waist circumference - use OBSERVATION.waist_circumference; and

            Not to be used to record the circumference of a body segment - use OBSERVATION.body_segment_circumference for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the area of a body segment - use OBSERVATION.body_segment_area for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the dimensions of an internal body organ or a lesion.
            
            Not to be used to record skinfold measurements - use archetypes that are specific for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to measure the Crown-rump length for a fetus, using imaging technology.
            
            Not to be used to record the measurement of the difference in length between paired body segments. Use the OBSERVATION.body_segment_length_discrepancy archetype for this purpose.">
