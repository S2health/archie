			purpose = <"To record the result, including findings and the laboratory's interpretation, of an investigation performed on specimens collected from an individual or related to that individual.">
			use = <"Use to record the result, including findings and the laboratory's interpretation, of an investigation performed on specimens collected from an individual or related to that individual. This is typically done in a laboratory, but may be done in other environments such as at the point of care.
            
            This archetype is intended to cover the result of a single ordered investigation where the specimen(s) are collected as a single procedure, and may include multiple analyte results or other components. Examples of this could include 'Full blood count', which would yield a separate analyte result for the count of each type of blood cell, or 'kidney biopsy non-neoplastic', which would yield findings from microscopy, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.
            
            This archetype has been designed to be a framework that will usually be extended with Node archetypes to enable appropriate recording of specific laboratory test result patterns. This includes, but is not limited to, tests for biochemistry, haematology, immunology and transfusion services etc and specific patterns for the unique requirements for microbiology and anatomical pathology. If the ordered tests or investigations do not commonly belong together in a named group or panel, each test result would normally be represented using separate instances of this archetype. There is, however, considerable variation in actual reporting/messaging practice and this archetype/related archetypes are designed to handle such variation.
            
            This archetype supports multiple approaches to recording of specimen, reflecting current practice which varies enormously. A Laboratory test result has a high degree of alignment to an HL7 FHIR Diagnostic Report resource.
            
            It is anticipated that one or more instances of this archetype, or archetype family, will be sent back to a requesting clinician within a laboratory report document comprising COMPOSITION.report_result archetype, or similar, and other relevant ENTRY archetypes.
            
            The recording of confounding factors may be inconsistent, often depending on the analysing laboratory and on clinical information sent by the requester. In the State section of the archetype there is a simple 'Confounding factors' data Node that is optional and can be repeated as one way to record a variety of simple factors that need to be made explicit as they may influence interpretation of the results. If the confounding factors are more complex, it may be appropriate to create a local/shared Node archetype that can be nested in the 'Confounding factors details' SLOT. 
            Note 1: Known or required pre-conditions, such as 'fasting' or 'Day 1 of menstrual cycle', should be reported in the 'Sampling conditions' data Node in the Node.specimen archetype, nested within this OBSERVATION archetype.
            Note 2: Known issues with specimen collection or handling, such as 'sample haemolysed' or 'prolonged use of tourniquet' should be reported within 'Specimen quality' in the Node.specimen archetype, nested within this OBSERVATION archetype.
            
            Where 'reflex tests' are performed by the laboratory, these may be handled as per US/FHIR guidance (see https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2015may/uslabreport-guide.html) or other local policy. For example, one of the following ...
            1. Record the reflex test results additional 'Test findings' within the same 'openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result'
            2. Record the reflex test results as 'Test findings' within a new 'openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result' but refer to the original lab test request via 'Test request details'.
            3. Record the reflex test results as 'Test findings' within a new 'openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result' but reference a new lab test request as well as the original lab test request via 'Test request details'.">
