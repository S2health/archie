			use = <"Use to record details about findings on physical examination of the subject of care. This may include a narrative description of the findings, a framework in which to nest detailed Node examination archetypes, and a clinical interpretation of the findings.
            
            Examples of detailed Node examination archetypes include those that describe inspection, palpation, auscultation, percussion and movement of body systems or anatomical structures, such as Node.exam_pupils.
            
            Narrative descriptions of clinical findings from existing clinical systems may be captured using the 'Description' data Node.
            
            Clinicians may sometimes want to record a summative phrase such as 'chronic otitis media' as an Interpretation of the physical examination. In the context of the physical examination archetype this should only be understood as 'physical signs are consistent with chronic otitis media'. While the summative phrase may appear to represent a diagnosis, safe and consistent querying requires a diagnosis to be recorded using the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype, even if the phrases are identical.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording history-taking observations - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom.
            
            Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure, OBSERVATION.body_weight, or OBSERVATION.height.">
