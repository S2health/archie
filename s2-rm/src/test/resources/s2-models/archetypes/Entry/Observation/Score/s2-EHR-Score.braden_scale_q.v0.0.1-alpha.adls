            There are two commonly used variants - one intended for hospital use and the other for home use. They differ only in the description of the Moisture data Node where the frequency of bedding change is described as \\\"three times per 24 hours\\\" for home use or \\\"once per shift\\\" for hospital use. As these two descriptions have the same essential meaning, this archetype has used the most generally applicable wording, based on the home use variant.
