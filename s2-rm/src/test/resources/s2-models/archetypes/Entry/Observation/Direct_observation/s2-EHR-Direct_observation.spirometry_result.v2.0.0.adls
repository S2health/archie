			use = <"Use to record the results of a pulmonary function test performed using a spirometer or peak flow meter.
            
            This archetype is intended to be used to record the results from:
            - electronic or mechanical measurement devices. Use the 'Type of measurement' Node in Protocol to record how the result was measured; 
            - oral, nasal or tracheostomy tests. Use the 'Method' Node in Protocol to record the type of breathing equipment used to perform the test. For example: mouth piece or face mask. Measurements with different 'Method' will have to be recorded using separate instances of the archetype.
            - inspiratory and expiratory tests. The name of each test will indicate whether the test records an inspiratory or expiratory result. 
            
            If the spirometry test is performed in association with the administration of bronchodilators or challenge substances, this can be recorded using the 'Challenge/reversibility' Node. Details of what was administered should be recorded using an instance of the ACTION.medication archetype committed within the same COMPOSITION.
            
            If additional information about body temperature, ambient pressure or humidity is required, this can be recorded using additional archetypes. Body temperature can be recorded using an instance of the OBSERVATION.body_temperature archetype committed within the same COMPOSITION. Ambient pressure or humidity can be recorded using the Node.environmental_conditions in the 'Enviromental conditions' slot.
            
            The 'Any event' can be cloned and constrained to support the representation of:
            - Multiple measurements and their average - clone the 'Any event' as many times as needed, plus an additional event set to 'Interval' and selecting the 'Mean' attribute;
            - Pre- and post bronchial challenge or bronchodilator results - clone the 'Any event' and rename as 'Baseline' and 'Post challenge/bronchodilator', associated with a time offset if required.">
