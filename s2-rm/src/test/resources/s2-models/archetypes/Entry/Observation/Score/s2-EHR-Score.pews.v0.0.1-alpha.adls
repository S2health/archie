            As there is no standard model for the component variables that make up PEWS, this archetype has been designed to provide a framework in which one specific PEWS representation can be selected and added to the 'PEWS components' SLOT added as Nodes in a template.">

            - OBSERVATION.blood_pressure;

            - OBSERVATION.respiration;

            Not to be used for adults. Use an archetype representing the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Use a pregnancy-specific archetype such as Maternal Early Warning Score or Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score for this purpose.">
