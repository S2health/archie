            A valid outcome of a GOSE assessment is that the 'Category' will have no result. The ordinal '99' in some Nodes is intended to represent an unscored value, and any Category calculation should take this into account. The 'Category' data Node should remain empty if the lowest recorded ordinal value is '99'.">
