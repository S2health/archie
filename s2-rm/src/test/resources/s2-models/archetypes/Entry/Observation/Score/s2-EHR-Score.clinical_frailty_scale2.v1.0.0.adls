            In 2020 the CFS was revised (version 2.0) with minor clarifying edits to the level descriptions and their corresponding labels. Most notably, CFS level 2 changed from \\\"Well\\\" to \\\"Fit\\\", level 4 from \\\"Vulnerable\\\" to \\\"Living with Very Mild Frailty\\\", and levels 5-8 were each restated as \\\"Living with...\\\"and added their respective grades of frailty.
