            Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
            - Checklist questions about whether the individual uses any devices or aids
            - Questionnaires about the usage of specific devices or aids
            
            In order to record the response at a specific point in time or within an interval of time, use the EVENT RM attribute.
            
            This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data. If the screening process identifies the usage of a specific device and it is intended that the details are to be recorded and persisted as part of an ongoing health record, any further specific details about the device should be recorded using the EVALUATION.device_summary archetype.">
