            The ESAS-r is intended to capture the patient’s perspective on symptoms, however in some cases where the patient is unable to self-report, the source of information may be from a carer. In this situation, record the care as the source of information using the Information provider attribute in the Reference Model.
            
            Each symptom is rated on a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 representing an absence of the symptom and 10 representing the maximal experience of the symptom. If it is not possible to rate a symptom, use the null flavour 'Not applicable' to indicate 'Unable to assess' on the relevant symptom.">
