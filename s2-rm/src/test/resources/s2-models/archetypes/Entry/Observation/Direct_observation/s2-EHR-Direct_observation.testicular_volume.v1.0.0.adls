            While the measurement of testicular volume may be one component of a full genital examination, this archetype for recording testicular volume has been developed as a standalone OBSERVATION to support the common monitoring of testicular volume by use of growth charts in childhood and puberty.
            
            Use to record change from repeated measurements. This can currently be modeled by constraining the 'any event' to an interval in a template with an associated mathematical function, as appropriate.">
