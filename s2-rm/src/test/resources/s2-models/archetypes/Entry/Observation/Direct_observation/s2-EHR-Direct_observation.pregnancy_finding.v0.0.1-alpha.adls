            This archetype has been designed to capture both the determination of a proven or possible presence of a pregnancy, as well as documenting the evidence supporting the determination. 
            
            This archetype should be regarded as a critical archetype by any clinical decision support system testing for presence or exclusion of a pregnancy, for example, prior to prescribing teratogenic medications or to exclude pregnancy related complications in the diagnosis of collapse or abdominal pain in women of child-bearing years.">

            Not to be used to record details about procedures performed during a pregnancy, for example terminations or deliveries. Use the ACTION.procedure or other relevant archetypes for this purpose.">
