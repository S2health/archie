			purpose = <"To record the body weight of an individual - both actual and approximate.">
			use = <"To be used for recording the actual measurement of body weight, including when the individual is missing a body part due to a congenital cause or after surgical removal.   A statement identifying the physical incompleteness of the body can be recorded in the 'Confounding factors' data Node, if required. This is the usual archetype to be used for a typical measurement of weight, for example self-measured by the individual at home, a clinician measurement in a clinic/hospital, or a fitness instructor in a gymnasium.  
            
            Can also be used for recording an approximation of body weight measurement in a clinical scenario where it is not possible to measure accurately body weight - for example, weighing an uncooperative child, or estimating the weight of an unborn fetus (where the 'subject of data' is the Fetus and recording occurs within the mother's health record).  This is not modelled explicitly in the archetype as the openEHR Reference model allows approximations  for any Quantity data type by setting the attribute Magnitude_status to the value '~'.  At implementation, for example, an application user interface could allow clinicians to select an appropriately labelled check box adjacent to the Weight data field to indicate that the recorded weight is an approximation, rather than actual.
            
            To be used for recording weight change, that is, either weight loss or weight gain.  This can currently be modelled by constraining the 'any event' to an interval with associated mathematical function of increase or decrease, as appropriate.">
