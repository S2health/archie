			purpose = <"To record the measurement of the distance around a part of the body, usually identified in relation to points of surface anatomy.">
			use = <"Use to record the measurement of the distance around a part of the body, usually identified in relation to points of surface anatomy, including an indication of the relative location of the measurement start/endpoint, if required. For example: to record that a measurement around the calf was taken 10cm distal to the tibial tuberosity.
            
            Body segment measurements that are ubiquitous and, most commonly, used as part of growth charting in childhood have been modelled as unique and discrete archetypes. Rather than create an archetype for every single possible body segment measurement, the intent of this archetype is to use a common recording pattern to capture any, or all, other possible measurements of measurements around a part of the body, identified by the 'Body segment name' data Node.
            
            This measurement may be recorded and tracked over time, for example to provide insight into the shape and proportions of an individual's body for purposes of clinical, anthropometric or ergonomic assessment, to record the measurement of abnormal clinical findings or observations in order to track the progress of a condition or disease.
            
            Common parameters that are measured as circumferences have been added to the DV_CODED_TEXT data type in the 'Body segment name' data Node. As further parameters are identified, these can be added to this list over time.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record common body segment measurements that have been modelled as separate archetypes, including, but not limited to:
            - for Head circumference - use OBSERVATION.head_circumference;
            - for Hip circumference - use OBSERVATION.hip_circumference;
            - for Waist circumference - use OBSERVATION.waist_circumference; and
            - for Chest circumference - use OBSERVATION.chest_circumference.
            
            Not to be used to record the circumference of an internal body organ or a lesion.
            
            Not to be used to record the length, height or width measured between two identified points on the body - use OBSERVATION.body_segment_length for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the area of a body segment - use OBSERVATION.body_segment_area for this purpose.">
