			purpose = <"To record the measurements recorded during a Nine Hole Peg Test, normally as part of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite suite of tests.">
			use = <"Use to record the measurements recorded during a Nine Hole Peg Test. This test is commonly carried out as one component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) assessment, but may be performed independently. Both the dominant and non-dominant hand of the patient are tested twice (two consecutive trials of the dominant hand, followed by two consecutive trials of the non-dominant hand). For each trial nine pegs are picked one by one from a container, placed in the holes on a pegboard and then separately returned to the container. The subject may only use one hand at each trial, but may hold the pegboard with the free hand.
            
            This archetype covers variations of the test. According to Mathiowetz et al. (1985) an untimed practice trial should be administered prior to the timed trial for each hand. The MSFC Manual stipulates two timed trials for each hand, but no practice trial. Use the MSFC Manual or see Mathiowetz et al. (1985) for detailed administration instructions. The test should only be administered by a suitably trained person.">
