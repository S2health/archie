            Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
            - Systematic enquiry in any consultation, for example:
            --- Are you homeless? Yes, No, Unknown
            --- Do you feel socially isolated?
            --- Do you feel safe at home/school/work?
            --- Do you think you are a problem gambler?
            --- Are any individuals dependent on you?
            --- Do you need an interpreter when you visit the clinic?
            
            The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data Node would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.
            
            The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to a point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about a social context issue that has been present at any time in the past and information about a social context issue within a specified time interval - for example, the difference between \\\"Are you safe at home now?\\\" compared to \\\"Have you experienced any domestic violence in the past 4 weeks?\\\"
            
            The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' Node in the Reference Model.
            
            This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening process identifies a social context circumstance, issue or concern and it is intended that the details are to be recorded and persisted as part of an ongoing health record, any further specific details about the social context should be recorded using archetypes specific for the clinical purpose.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used to record persistent details about social context-related concepts. Use existing archetypes for this purpose - for example EVALUATION.housing, EVALUATION.education, EVALUATION. occupation, EVALUATION.social_network and other archetypes within the Social context project - https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/projects/1013.30.39.">
