            The body segment area may be recorded and tracked over time, for example to provide insight into the shape and proportions of an individual's body for purposes of clinical, anthropometric or ergonomic assessment.
            
            Common parameters that are measured as circumferences have been added to the DV_CODED_TEXT data type in the 'Body segment name' data Node. As further parameters are identified, these can be added to this list over time.">
