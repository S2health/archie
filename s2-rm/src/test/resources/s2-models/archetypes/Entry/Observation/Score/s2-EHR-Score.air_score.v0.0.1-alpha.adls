            AIR is an acronym for Appendicitis Inflammatory Response and consists of seven components, each contributing points to the total score generating an estimated probability as well as a recommendation based on the risk level; 
            - Vomiting 0-1
            - Pain in right inferior fossa 0-1
            - Rebound tenderness or muscular defense 0-3
            - Body temperature ≥38.5 0-1
            - Neutrophils 0-2
            - White blood cell count 0-2
            - CRP 0-2
            
            The tool has a maximum score of 12 points, and the result is associated with one of three categories estimating probability along with a recommendation on appropriate action;
            Sum 0-4 - low probability. Consider outpatient follow-up if unaltered general condition.
            Sum 5-8 - indeterminate group. Consider in-hospital active observation with rescoring and/or further examination in accordance with local tradition.
            Sum 9-12 - high probability. Consider surgical exploration.">
