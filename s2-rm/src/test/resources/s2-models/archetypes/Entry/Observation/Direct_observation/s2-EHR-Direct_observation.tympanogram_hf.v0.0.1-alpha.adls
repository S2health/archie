			purpose = <"To record measurements based on a multi-frequency (or sweep frequency) probe tone, or a probe tone higher than 226Hz, of the admittance or impedance of the middle ear system as a function of the pressure in the external ear canal pressure.
            
            To infer middle ear function from objective measurements based on a high frequency probe tone, taken at the tympanic membrane of the mobility of the tympanic membrane, in reponse to varying air pressure in the ear canal.
            
            To infer middle ear function from objective measurements based on a multi-frequency probe tone, taken at the tympanic membrane of the mobility of the tympanic membrane, in reponse to a specified air pressure in the ear canal.">
			use = <"Use to record measurements taken during tympanometry with a high frequency probe tone (probetone higher than 226 Hz) or a multi-frequency probe tone.
            
            Use to record outcome of tympanometry screening based on a high frequency probe tone (probe tone higher than 226 Hz) or a multi-frequency probe tone.
            
            Use to record the interpretation all tympanogram measurements taken with a high frequency probe tone (probetone higher than 226 Hz) or a multi-frequency probe tone, to infer middle ear function for each ear, plus an overall interpretation (or tympanometric diagnosis). 
            
            All of the data Nodes are recorded using a single method or protocol. If, during the test, any of the protocol parameters need to be modified, then the subsequent part of the test will need to be recorded within a separate instance of the test data, using the updated protocol parameters.
            
            High frequency tympanometry is the test of choice in newborn to the age of two months. Both 226hz and high frequency tympanometry can be used together to test infants from from two to six months.">
