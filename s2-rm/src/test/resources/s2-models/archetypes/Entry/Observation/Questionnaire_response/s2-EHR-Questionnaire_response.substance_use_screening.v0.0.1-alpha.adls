            use = <"Use to create a framework for recording answers to pre-defined screening questions about the use of any specified substance or a grouping of substances without a prescription or beyond its intended scope or expected use.
            
            Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
            - Systematic questioning in any consultation, for example:
            --- Do you smoke? Yes, No, Unknown
            --- For how long have you been smoking?
            --- Have you ever injected drugs? Yes, No, Unknown.
            --- Do you use performance enhancing substances? Yes, No, Unknown.
            --- Have you been drinking alcohol the last four weeks? Yes, No, Unknown.
            - Questions related to use of specific substances.	
            
            The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data Node would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.
            
            The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about a medication that has been used at any time in the past and information about a medication used within a specified time interval - for example the difference between \\\"Do you drink alcohol?\\\" compared to \\\"Have you been drinking any alcohol during the last four weeks?\\\". 
            
            The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' Node in the Reference Model.
            
            This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies the presence of a substance it is recommended that clinical system record and persist the specific details about the substance using a relevant archetype, for example the EVALUATION.tobacco_smoking_summary or the EVALUATION.substance_use_summary archetypes.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used for recording a summary of use of a substance over the lifetime of the individual - use EVALUATION.substance_use_summary for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used for recording a summary of use of tobacco over the lifetime of the individual - use EVALUATION.smokeless_tobacco_summary or EVALUATION.tobacco_smoking_summary for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used for recording a summary of use of alcohol over the lifetime of the individual - use EVALUATION.alcohol_consumption_summary for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record event-or period-based information about the use of a substance, outside of a screening context - use a relevant OBSERVATION.archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used for recording information about the use of a medication, putside of a screening context. Use a relevant medication archetype for this purpose.">
