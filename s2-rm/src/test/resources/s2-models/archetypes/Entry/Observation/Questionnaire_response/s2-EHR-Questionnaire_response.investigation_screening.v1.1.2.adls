            purpose = <"To create a framework for recording answers to pre-defined screening questions about diagnostic investigations or group of investigations, including but not limited to imaging examinations and laboratory tests.">

            use = <"Use to create a framework for recording answers to pre-defined screening questions about diagnostic investigations or groups of investigations. The scope of diagnostic investigations includes all modalities of imaging examinations and the broadest range of laboratory and anatomical pathology tests. In addition, this archetype can also be used to record when other diagnostic tests have been carried out, such as cardiac stress testing, hearing and vision testing, electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG).
            
            Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
            - Patient self-reporting
            - Creating a patient profile in a disease registry
            - Systematic questioning in any consultation related to patterns of investigation administration
            
            The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. Each data Node would usually be renamed in a template to represent the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted to align with local requirements by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case. 
            
            Utilising this framework within a template can enable documentation of a broad range of question/answer pairs such as:
            - Have you ever had your cholesterol level tested? Yes, No, Unknown.
            - Have you been tested for rubella antibodies? Yes, No, Unknown.
            - Have you ever been screened for sickle cell disease? Yes, No, Unknown.
            - When was your last Chest X-ray?
            - What was the result of your most recent INR test?
            - What were the findings of the electrocardiogram?
            - Did the infant pass/fail a Neonatal hearing screen?
            
            The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to a point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about an investigation or test that has been done at any time in the past and information about an investigation or test done within a specified time interval - for example, the difference between \\\"Have you ever had an INR test?\\\" compared to \\\"Have you had an INR test during the last four weeks?\\\".
            
            The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' Node in the Reference Model.
            
            This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies an investigation has been carried out, additional details required for persistence as part of a clinical record can be captured using specific test result archetypes.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used for recording an order for an investigation - use INSTRUCTION.service_request for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used for recording the progress of activities performed as part of an investigation - use appropriate ACTION archetypes for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record formal diagnostic test results - use appropriate OBSERVATIONS for this purpose. For example, the OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result or OBSERVATION.imaging_examination_result.">
