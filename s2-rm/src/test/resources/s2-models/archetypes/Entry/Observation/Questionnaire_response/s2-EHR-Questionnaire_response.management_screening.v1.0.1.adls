            use = <"Use to create a framework for recording answers to pre-defined screening questions about the broad range of clinical management that has been carried out in the past, with the exception of medications or surgical/operative procedures.
            
            Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
            - Systematic questioning in any consultation, for example:
            --- Have you ever been admitted to hospital? 
            --- Have you ever worn compression stockings? 
            --- Have you ever been placed on a ventilator? 
            --- Have you ever been on dialysis?
            
            - Specific questioning related to disease surveillance.
            --- Was the patient isolated on admission? Yes, No, Unkown.
            --- Did the patient receive home oxygen therapy? Yes, No, Unkown.
            --- Was the patient admitted to ICU? Yes, No, Unkown.
            
            The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data Node would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.
            
            The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about management that has been performed at any time in the past and information about management performed within a specified time interval - for example the difference between \\\"Have you been admitted to hospital?\\\" compared to \\\"Have you been admitted to hospital in the past 4 weeks.
            
            The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' Node in the Reference Model.
            
            This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies the presence of management or treatment, it is recommended that clinical system record and persist the specific details about the management or treatment using archetypes specific for the clinical purpose.">
