It intends to identify risk of poor protein-energy status, rather than status of individual nutrients. It has not been designed to detect deficiencies in or excessive intakes of vitamins and minerals. It was developed and is maintained by the British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (BAPEN).">

            Step 1.- Measure height and weight to get a BMI score. If unable to obtain height and weight, the alternative procedures shown in the MUST Explanatory Booklet should be used.

            Step 3.- Establish acute disease effect and score.
            Step 4.- Add scores from steps 1, 2 and 3 together to obtain overall risk of malnutrition.
            Step 5.- Use management guidelines and/or local policy to develop care plan.
