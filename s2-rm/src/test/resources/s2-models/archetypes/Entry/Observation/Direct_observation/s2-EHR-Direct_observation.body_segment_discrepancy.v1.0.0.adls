			purpose = <"To record the difference in length or circumference between paired body segments.">
			use = <"Use to record the difference in length or circumference between paired body segments. Body segment length is a measurement of the distance between two points of surface anatomy, and body segment circumference is the measurement of the distance around an identified part of the body.
            
            The design intent of this archetype is to use a common recording pattern to capture length discrepancies between paired body segments, identified by the 
            'Paired body segment name' data Node.
            
            The discrepancy may be recorded and tracked over time, for example tracking the disrepancy as a child grows, 
            or used to provide insight into the shape and proportions of an individual's body for purposes of clinical, 
            anthropometric or ergonomic assessment. 
            
            Common parameters that are measured between two identified points have been added to the DV_CODED_TEXT data 
            type in the 'Body segment name' data Node. As further parameters are identified, these can be added to the list within the 'Body segment name' Node.
            
            The Nodes 'Measurement method', 'Measurement origin', 'Structured origin', 'Measurement endpoint' and 
            'Structured endpoint' is redundant if already recorded in the OBSERVATION.body_segment_length when recording 
            the actual length of the body segments.">
