            The total score, derived by adding up the individual scores for each of the 8 items ranges from 0 to 10 with score weights allocated thus:
            
            +2 points - Right lower quadrant tenderness
            +1 point - Elevated temperature (>37.3°C or 99.1°F)
            +1 point - Rebound tenderness
            +1 point - Migration of pain to the right lower quadrant
            +1 point - Anorexia
            +1 point - Nausea or vomiting
            +2 point - Leukocytosis > 10,000
            +1 point - Leukocyte left shift 
            
            - A CT scan is recommended for scores 4-6 
            - A surgical consultation for scores  ≥ 7. 
            - For scores  ≤ 3: a CT scan is not needed due to the low probability of appendicitis.">
