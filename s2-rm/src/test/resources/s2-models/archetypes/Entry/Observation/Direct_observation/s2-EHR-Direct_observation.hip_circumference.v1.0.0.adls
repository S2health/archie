			use = <"Use to record the measurement of the distance around the hips, usually taken at the largest circumference including the buttocks.
            
            Use to record change from repeated measurements. This can currently be modeled by constraining the 'Any event' to an interval in a template with an associated mathematical function, as appropriate.
            
            This archetype can also be used for recording an approximation of the hip circumference measurement in a clinical scenario where it is not possible to measure an accurate hip circumference - for example, measuring an uncooperative child. This is not modelled explicitly in the archetype as the openEHR Reference model allows the attribute of Approximation for any Quantity data type. At implementation, for example, an application user interface could allow clinicians to select an appropriately labelled check box adjacent to the 'Hip circumference' data field to indicate that the recorded hip circumference is an approximation, rather than actual.">
			keywords = <"anthropometry", "measurement", "circumference">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the speed of which the hip circumference is increasing or decreasing. Use the OBSERVATION.growth_velocity archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the circumference of another body part. Use OBSERVATION.body_segment in these circumstances except where more specific archetypes exist such as OBSERVATION.waist_circumference.">
