            This archetype has been designed to support the explicit recording of Apgar scores at 1, 2, 3, 5 and/or 10 minute points in time offset from the time of birth, plus additional events as required.
            
            Usual practice is to document the Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes; further scores can be recorded as clinically indicated.  It is possible to record the Apgar score at any time after birth using this archetype.
            
            Common clinical practice is to record all 5 parameters plus the total, however this archetype allows any partial information to be recorded, if that is all that is available for example from historical data.">
