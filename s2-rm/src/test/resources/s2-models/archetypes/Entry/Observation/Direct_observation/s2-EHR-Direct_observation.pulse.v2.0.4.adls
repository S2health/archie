            In practice, the terms 'heart rate' and 'pulse rate' are often used interchangeably, although they may be measured at different body sites. This archetype is intended to be used for either term and the measurement site Node is used to differentiate them.
            
            Use to record the measurement of the pulse rate, or heart rate, observations about the associated pattern and character, and clinical interpretation of the findings.
            
            Measurements such as the maximum pulse or heart rate over an interval of time can be recorded using 'Maximum' event. Others point-in-time or interval events may be specified within a template or at run-time.
            
            In development of this archetype, there has been some tension around representation of the regularity of the pulse or heart beat. This archetype represents the relevant data points separately: firstly establishing 'Regular' vs 'Irregular' and then, if 'Irregular', further options of 'Regularly irregular' and 'Irregularly irregular'. In practice, clinical systems could offer users a combination of the values from the 'Regularity' and 'Irregular type' - for example, 'Regular', 'Regularly irregular' and 'Irregularly irregular' drawn from these two data Nodes. Data could be recorded against both data Nodes with the assumption that if one of the irregular types are selected, then the 'Irregular' value in the 'Regularity' data Node is also automatically selected.
            
            In certain situations it is important to be very specific so that a rate observed at a peripheral body site, such as the radial artery, can be differentiated from the rate of the heart. To record a pulse deficit, record the measurements of the mechanical heart rate and a peripheral pulse rate in two instances of this archetype - the difference between these measurments is the pulse deficit. The actual pulse deficit will be recorded in a separate OBSERVATION archetype.">
			keywords = <"rate", "rhythm", "beat", "pulse", "heart", "vital", "sign">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the R-R rate in the context of an Electrocardiograph report - use the OBSERVATION.ecg archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record other details of the full cardiovascular examination or assessment. Other specific Node archetypes will be used to record characteristics such as apex beat, murmurs and bruits, or auscultatory findings.
            
            In particular, this archetype is not intended to record the assessment of peripheral vascular disease, which requires documentation of the presence and strength of each peripheral pulse. A specific Node archetype will be used to record the general findings on examination of peripheral pulses. 
            
            Not to be used to record fetal heart rate - use the OBSERVATION.fetal_heart archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the pulse deficit - use a specific OBSERVATION archetype for this purpose.
            
            Concepts such as Target Heart Rate should be recorded in separate EVALUATION archetypes related to goals and exercise assessment.">
