            This archetype has been designed to capture whether a reaction occurred after administration of an agent to an individual. This includes but is not limited to montoring during or after vaccinations, chemotherapy, or blood transfusions. It includes details about any mitigation efforts in the context of administration, such as corticosteroid cover, or ICU admission. Details about a reaction that occurred can be recorded using the Node.reaction_event archetype in the 'Reaction event' SLOT.">

            Not to be used to record the result of the administration of a substance with the intention of provoking a reaction, for example Mantoux or skin prick tests. Use other appropriate OBSERVATION archetypes for this purpose.
