			use = <"Use to record the findings on imaging examination of a specified body structure or region and their interpretation, using radiological techniques.
            
            This archetype has been designed to focus on the reporting of findings and interpretation associated with a single imaging examination (equivalent to a single DICOM study). References to DICOM-related attributes are included but the focus is on the representation of a clinical report from an imaging examination and not on representing DICOM-related attributes that might be expected within a radiology information system. Specific details about the DICOM series can be recorded using the Node.imaging_series nested within the 'Series details' SLOT.
            
            Detailed findings observed during an imaging examination and targeting a specified structure or region can be recorded by nesting the Node.imaging_exam and/or its family of specialised archetypes within the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT in this archetype. It is intended that over time the specific detail in each specialisation will grow to include findings using all imaging modalities.
            
            If an imaging examination is carried out as part of a more complex activity, such as a surgical operation carried out under imaging guidance, the imaging findings should be recorded using this archetype. 
            Structured details about the surgical procedure and medications or contrast administered should be recorded using the ACTION.procedure and/or ACTION.medication archetypes, respectively. In this situation, it is recommended that all related archetypes should be reported within the same template.
            
            This result will normally be reported back to the requesting clinician as one component within the context of an overall COMPOSITION-based report.">
