This test is commonly carried out as one component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) assessment, but may be performed independently. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot (7,62 m) course. Then he is instructed to walk this course as quickly as possible, but safely. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Assistive devices (in general, customary walking devices) may be used when doing this task. Use the MSFC Manual for detailed administration instructions. The test should only be administred by a suitably trained person.">
