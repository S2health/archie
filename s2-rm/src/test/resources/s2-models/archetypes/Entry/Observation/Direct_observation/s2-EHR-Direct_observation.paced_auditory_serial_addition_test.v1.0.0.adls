            use = <"Use to record the measurements recorded during a Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. This test is commonly carried out as one component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, but may be performed independently. 61 single-digit numbers are presented to the subject one by one. During PASAT-3'' a new number is presented every three seconds, in the optional PASAT-2'' every two seconds. In each case the subject is asked to respond with the sum of the last two digits (not the running total). That is, there is a maximum of 60 possible correct sums.
            
            Use the MSFC Manual for detailed administration instructions. Prior to the recording of the actual tests at least one practice trial has to be performed (this training sequence is part of the PASAT). If less than three correct answers were given, the practice trial should be repeated (up to three times). If more than two correct answers were given, the PASAT-3'' can be administered (the patient should have understood the task sufficiently). To obtain additional information about the cognitive functions, the PASAT-2'' can be performed optionally after the 3'' test. The tests should only be administered by a suitably trained person.">
