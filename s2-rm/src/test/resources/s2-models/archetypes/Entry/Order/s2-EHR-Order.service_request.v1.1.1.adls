            This archetype has been designed as a framework that can be used as the basis for:
            - a request from one clinician, organization or agency to another clinician, organization or agency for a health-related service. For example: a referral to a specialist clinician for treatment or a second clinical opinion; transfer of care to an emergency department; four hourly vital signs monitoring; and provision of home services from a municipal council; or
            - a request for a follow up service to be scheduled for the same clinician, organization or agency. For example: a review appointment in outpatients in 6 weeks. 
            
            Clinical use cases:
            - consider a clinician ordering a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks. 'Follow-up appointment' will be the 'Service name'. If they enter '6 weeks' as the proposed timing for the appointment in the User Interface, the clinical system will record the date six weeks from today in the 'Service due' data Node.
            - consider a clinician ordering Diabetes Education as the 'Service name'. The values for 'Reason for request' may be 'New diagnosis' and 'Prevention of ketoacidosis'. The 'Clinical indication' will be 'Diabetes Type 1', which may be linked to the Problem Diagnosis and/or Laboratory test results. If a 4 week course is required, with sessions organised at weekly intervals on 4 separate occasions, then the complex timing requires use of the Node.service_direction and associated Node.timing_nondaily archetype.
            - consider a clinician ordering a recurring blood test, such as an INR. The complex timing for this requires use of the Node.service_direction and associated Node.timing_nondaily archetype to define each timing in a sequence of tests, such as 'daily for one week, weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 6 months'.
            
            The default assumption for this archetype is that it's a request for a single service. If a series of services are required, use the Node.service_direction archetype within the 'Complex timing' SLOT.
            
            In many situations it will be possible to record the steps that occur as part of this request being carried out using the corresponding generic ACTION.service. However, there will be many occasions where the required ACTION archetype will be very specific for purpose, as the data requirements for recording provision of many health-related services will need quite unique data Nodes, recording patterns or pathway steps. For example: ACTION.screening or ACTION.health_education.">
