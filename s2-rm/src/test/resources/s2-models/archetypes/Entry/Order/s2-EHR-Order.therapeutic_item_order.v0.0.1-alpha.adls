            The scope of this archetype includes, but is not limited to an order for:

            - a walking boot to be used for 6 weeks to treat an ankle sprain
            - hearing aids
            - non-medicated bandages or dressings
            - a positive expiratory pressure device for lung physiotherapy
            - a Frejka pillow or a Pavlik harness for treatment for developmental dysplasia of the hip
            - an insulin pump
            
            This archetype is designed to be used in a number of clinical contexts, including but not limited to:
            - a record in a clinical consultation (COMPOSITION.encounter); or
            - a written order by a health professional for a therapeutic item to be dispensed, administered and/or applied.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the activities related to carrying out the order for the therapeutic item, such as details about actual administration or application. Use the appropiate ACTION-archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the ordering of blood products, which involves a fundamentally different clinical process and is likely to require different supporting information Use the INSTRUCTION.transfusion for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the order for insertion of implants or medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators. Use the INSTRUCTION.procedure for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record an order for a medication, vaccine, or nutritional product for an identified individual. Use the INSTRUCTION.medication_order for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record an order for a therapeutic activity, such as exercise or daily peak flow measurements - use a specific archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record an order for a medical device or therapeutic item that would be used as part of a procedure by a health professional - this would most likely be part of supply chain ordering and logistics.">
