            This archetype has been designed to be a framework that will be adequate for requesting and recording a simple consent, but allow for additional details to be optionally added within the 'Details' SLOT to meet the specific requirements of a more complex clinical scenario.  For example, additional consent details can be included using the Node.consent_details archetype. Other archetypes can be developed and optionally included in the same SLOT for the purpose of recording specific details about the procedure, trial or activity. 
            
            The status of the informed consent is reflected by the pathway steps - requested, refused, provided, withdrawn etc.">
