            use = <"Use to record information about the activities required to support all aspects of medication management, including the planning, scheduling, suspension, cancellation and completion of medication orders, as well as the actual administration of medication items. This is done by the recording of data against specific activities, as defined by the 'Pathway' careflow steps in this archetype.
            
            This archetype is intended to be used for any type of medication and related order, whether prescribed by a health professional or available for purchase 'over the counter'. The scope of this medication archetype also includes orders for vaccinations, parenteral fluids or other therapeutic goods, such as bandages, nutritional products or other items that are applied or administered to have a therapeutic effect and which have a common pattern for data recording. Within the context of a Medication or Vaccination List, this archetype will be used to record only what medication or vaccination has been prescribed or administered.
            
            Additional structured and detailed information about the activity can be captured using purpose-specific archetypes inserted into the 'Preparations details', 'Amount', 'Structured body site', 'Administration device' or 'Additional details' SLOTs, where required.
            
            Timings related to medication management can be managed in one of two ways:
            - Using the reference model - the time for performance of any pathway step will use the ACTION time attribute for each step.
            - Archetyped data Nodes - the 'Original scheduled date/time' data Node is intended to record the time when the medication item was intended to be administered. Note: the corresponding ACTION time attribute for the Scheduled pathway step will record the time that the clinical activity was scheduled into a system, not the intended date/time on which the activity is intended to be carried out.
            
            In practice, some medications (for example, during resuscitation in the emergency department) will be administered on the basis of a protocol or verbal order and not be ordered in advance. The details about the medication will be added against the pathway step 'Dose administered'. For an ongoing course of medication, data about the medication item will be recorded against the 'Dose administered' step at each administration, leaving the instruction in the active state. When the last occurrence is recorded the ‘Medication course completed' step is recorded showing that this order is now in the completed state.
            
            In other situations, such as secondary care, there may be a formal order for a medication item using a corresponding INSTRUCTION.medication_order archetype. This ACTION archetype can then be used to record the workflow of when and how the order has been carried out.
            
            Recording information using this ACTION archetype indicates that some sort of activity has actually occurred; this will most commonly be the administration of the medication item itself, but may be a delayed supply attempt or another activity such as suspending the medication item in preparation for a procedure. If there is a formal order for the medication item, the state of this order is represented by the Pathway step against which the data is recorded. For example, using this archetype the progressing state of a Paracetamol order may be recorded through separate entries in the EHR progress notes at each 'Pathway' step. When documenting the reason for why an activity was performed or a pathway step was chosen, for example why a dose was omitted or the medication was ceased, the Node \\\"Reason\\\" may be used. 
            
            When this ACTION archetype is used with the corresponding INSTRUCTION.medication_order archetype, information which hasn't changed from the order to the management activity aren't generally repeated in the action. It's considered good practice, though not mandatory, to record the medication item in the ACTION.
            
            The pathway steps make a distinction between those which relate directly to fulfillment of the order, such as authorisation, preparation and dose administration, and those which relate to handling of the prescription such as issue, re-authorisation, dispensing. In some jurisdictions these are regarded as a single pathway, in others it may be helpful to handle order fulfillment and prescription in separate templates.
            
            The names of most of the pathway steps in this archetype start with either \\\"Medication\\\" or \\\"Prescription\\\" to make it easier to differentiate between the pathway steps that are associated with prescription handling and those that are associated with handling the medication order itself.
            
            In some jurisdictions, a prescription can be re-authorised for the purpose of continuing an ongoing medication order, while in others an entirely new prescription must be issued in these circumstances. In the latter, the pathway step 'Prescription re-authorised' is not applicable.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used for recording a medication order or instruction. Use the INSTRUCTION.medication_order archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used to record the administration or dispensing of blood products, which involves a fundamentally different clinical process and is likely to require different supporting information. Use a different appropriate ACTION archetype for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used for recording details about therapeutic adherence, secondary effects or toxicity. Use other archetypes for these purposes.
            
            Not to be used for medication reconcilliation. Use other appropriate archetypes for this purpose.
            
            Not to be used for a formal review of an entire medication list, for example by a pharmacist. Use other appropriate archetypes for this purpose.">
