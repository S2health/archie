			use = <"Used to represent the names by which a person is known. ISO 22220 allows more than one usage for a name. openEHR reference model allows a single usage for a person name (indicated by the LOCATABLE class name attribute. This attribute should not be confused with the person name). Besides, two different names for a single person cannot have the same usage. If it is necessary to represent two or more usages for the same name, two PARTY_IDENTITY (ies) for the same person name (differing in the name attribute and possibly in the Nodes time validity and identifier) must be created. In case a person has two names with the same usage (for example, two aliases), the system must use different values in each name attribute ('alias1', 'alias2' ..., for instance). In this case, the ISO 22220 list of values allowed for name usage cannot be used. The application should ensure that either full name or family name be present.">
